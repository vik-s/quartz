Category: #articles\n\n## Highlights\n- Frequency illusion, also known as the Baader‚ÄìMeinhof phenomenon or frequency bias, is a cognitive bias referring to the tendency to notice something more often after noticing it for the first time, leading to the belief that it has an increased frequency of occurrence.[1][2][3] The illusion is a result of increased awareness of a phrase, idea, or object ‚Äì for example, hearing a song more often or seeing red cars everywhere.[4]\n  The name \"Baader-Meinhof phenomenon\" was coined in 1994 by Terry Mullen in a letter to the St. Paul Pioneer Press.[5] The letter describes how, after mentioning the name of the German terrorist group Baader-Meinhof once, he kept noticing it. This led to other readers sharing their own experiences of the phenomenon, leading it to gain recognition. It was not until 2005, when Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky wrote about this effect on his blog, that the name \"frequency illusion\" was coined.[2]\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Articles/How-to-Build-Your-Personal-Braintrust":{"title":"","content":"# How to Build Your Personal Braintrust\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Sahil Bloom's Curiosity Chronicle]]\n- Full Title: How to Build Your Personal Braintrust\n- Category: #articles\n\n## Highlights\n- The general model of the Braintrust‚Äîa group of individuals with different perspectives and lenses, asking questions and pressure testing assumptions to improve the quality of the final product‚Äîis one that we can all apply to our lives in the context of our own personal and professional pursuits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hckfhqe7dezr18jwn89yb01c))\n    - Tags: [[.]] \n- How to Build Your Braintrust\n  Your Braintrust is a group of 5-10 individuals.\n  A few key features of the members of the group:\n  1. Unbiased (ideally not family).\n  2. Diverse experiences, perspectives, lenses.\n  3. Willing to provide raw feedback and candor.\n  4. Vested interest in your success (i.e. they want to see you win).\n  As you construct your Braintrust, it may be helpful to think about each member as fitting one particular archetype:\n  ‚Ä¢ Senior executive: navigating hierarchies and senior ranks.\n  ‚Ä¢ Inspirational leader: leadership principles and people management.\n  ‚Ä¢ Intellectual sparring partner: willing to pressure test your thinking.\n  ‚Ä¢ Contrarian thinker: willing to play the devil‚Äôs advocate.\n  ‚Ä¢ Connector: deep relationships and network.\n  ‚Ä¢ Peer: similar personal or professional stage to you.

It‚Äôs time to acknowledge that we can‚Äôt ‚Äúuse our head‚Äù to store everything we need to know and to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines\n- Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.\n- This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas\n- your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case\n- For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a ‚Äúknowledge building block‚Äù‚Äîa discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.\n- The length and format don‚Äôt matter‚Äîif a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.\n    - Note: This is different from zettelkasten where a note is meant to be a concise unit of information\n- So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom\n- Your brain is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful\n- This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can‚Äôt fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.\n- Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.\n- In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges.\n- Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.\n- Our careers and businesses depend more than ever on our ability to advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it as well.6\n  Advocating for a particular point of view isn‚Äôt just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material.\n- To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I‚Äôve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called ‚ÄúCODE‚Äù‚ÄîCapture; Organize; Distill; Express.\n- When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Don‚Äôt make it an analytical decision, and don‚Äôt worry about why exactly it resonates‚Äîjust look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it‚Äôs time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.\n- The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, ‚ÄúHow is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?‚Äù\n- Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic.\n- There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence.\n- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?‚Äù That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.\n- Information becomes knowledge‚Äîpersonal, embodied, verified‚Äîonly when we put it to use.\n- This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating\n- Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others‚Äîby inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.\n- Creativity depends on a creative process.\n- Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts\n- Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner‚Äôs Approach to Capturing\n- It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you\n- You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.\n- The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital notes is saving too much.\n- The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.II\n- Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.\n- As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you‚Äôre taking in. This special feeling of ‚Äúresonance‚Äù‚Äîlike an echo in your soul‚Äîis your intuition telling you that something is literally ‚Äúnoteworthy.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to figure out exactly why it resonates. Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may skip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly slow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it‚Äôs time to hit ‚Äúsave.‚Äù\n- It‚Äôs a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note\n- Twyla Tharp‚Äôs box reveals the true value of a simple container: it is easy to use, easy to understand, easy to create, and easy to maintain\n- We don‚Äôt need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works\n- the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example‚Äîthink of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven‚Äîwe tend to think in more abstract ways. When we‚Äôre in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we‚Äôre more likely to think concretely.\n- Your Second Brain isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they don‚Äôt happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. It‚Äôs time for us to put more intention into the digital environments where we now spend so many of our waking hours\n- Once you‚Äôve created this environment, you‚Äôll know where to go when it‚Äôs time to execute or create. You won‚Äôt have to sit down and spend half an hour painstakingly gathering together all the materials you need to get started. Your Second Brain is like a mind cathedral that you can step into any time you want to shut out the world and imagine a world of your own.\n- As you begin to capture your ideas in a consistent way, you‚Äôre likely to experience a new sense of excitement about the information flowing all around you.\n  You‚Äôll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you have, and the interviews you listen to, knowing that any interesting idea you encounter can be reliably saved and utilized\n- Soon, however, you‚Äôll run head on into a new problem: what to do with all this valuable material you‚Äôve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger this problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and retrieve them only leads to more overwhelm.\n- libraries. I tried organizing my files by date, by subject, by kind, and countless other elaborate schemes, but every method I tried soon failed.\n  The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away from my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and obsolete\n- eventually named this organizing system PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.II\n- it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.\n- The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: ‚ÄúIn which project will this be most useful?‚Äù It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.\n- dedicated places for each of the main ‚Äúareas‚Äù of your life\n- resources,‚Äù which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration\n- archives‚Äù to keep them out of sight but within easy reach.\n- Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you‚Äôre working on now.\n  Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.\n  Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.\n  Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.\n- Knowing which projects you‚Äôre currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren‚Äôt important.\n- This is why it‚Äôs so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: ‚Äúkeeping what resonates‚Äù in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term\n- This points to a paradox that a lot of people experience as they take notes: the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, the more time and effort it takes to review it all, and the less time they have to do so\n- Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you‚Äôve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project\n- The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several ‚Äúlayers.‚Äù Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart\n- This is what I call ‚Äúlayer one‚Äù‚Äîthe chunks of text initially captured in my notes\n- To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation\n- All I have to do is bold the main points within the note\n- For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting\n- There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I‚Äôll add an ‚Äúexecutive summary‚Äù at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words\n- recommend using bullet points\n- Use your own words,\n- With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain\n- This is actually a great way to filter down the volume of notes you‚Äôre taking‚Äîthe best stuff always sticks in your mind for an hour or two\n- The result points to a mysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so simple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort that was needed to get there\n- One of Pablo Picasso‚Äôs most famous drawings, created in 1945 and known as Picasso‚Äôs Bull, offers a master class in how distillation works\n- Ken Burns, the renowned creator of award-winning films like The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz, has said that only a tiny percentage of the raw footage he captures eventually makes it into the final cut\n- for every forty to fifty hours of footage he captures, only one hour makes it into the final film\n- You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without leaving some points out. You cannot make a highlight reel of a video without cutting some of the footage. You cannot give an effective presentation without leaving out some slides.\n- A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10‚Äì20 percent of the previous layer\n- When should I be doing this highlighting?‚Äù The answer is that you should do it when you‚Äôre getting ready to create something.\n- every time you ‚Äútouch‚Äù a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII\n- If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences\n- As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.\n- The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.\n- The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know\n- that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity\n- Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make\n- Ask yourself: How could you acquire or assemble each of these components, instead of having to make them yourself?\n- These are some of the most valuable connections‚Äîwhen an idea crosses the boundaries between subjects\n- As powerful as search can be, studies5 have found that in many situations people strongly prefer to navigate their file systems manually, scanning for the information they‚Äôre looking for\n- there are limitations to what you can find by browsing folders\n- often you have no idea where to put it\n- each other, making it\n- The CODE Method is based on an important aspect of creativity: that it is always a remix of existing parts.\n- As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you‚Äôll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible.\n- Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble.\n- We learn by making concrete things‚Äîbefore we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it‚Äôs going\n- You‚Äôll naturally seek venues to show your work\n- You‚Äôll read differently\n- building. You‚Äôll ask sharper questions,\n- You‚Äôll begin to act more deliberately\n- You have to value your ideas enough to share them.\n- You have to believe that the smallest idea has the\n- potential to change people‚Äôs lives. If you don‚Äôt believe that now, start with the smallest project you can think of to begin to prove to yourself that your ideas can make a difference.\n- Chapter\n- I saw how rigorous his routines had to be to allow him to pursue his creative calling while raising a family.\n- He had a series of what he called his ‚Äústrategies.‚Äù These were habits and tricks that he used to integrate creativity into every aspect of his life and quickly get into a creative state of mind whenever he had time to paint.\n- he was collecting, sifting through, reflecting on, and recombining raw material from his daily life so that when it came time to create, he had more than enough raw material to work with.\n- We can‚Äôt expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand\n- I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness\n- Through the simple acts of capturing ideas, organizing them into groups, distilling the best parts, and assembling them together to create value for others, we are practicing the basic moves of knowledge work in such a way that we can improve on them over time\n- Our notes are things to use, not just things to collect.\n- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work\n- To create an Archipelago of Ideas, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense\n- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining‚Äîlaying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together\n- Instead of starting with scarcity, start with abundance‚Äîthe abundance of interesting insights you‚Äôve collected in your Second Brain.\n- the ‚ÄúHemingway Bridge.‚Äù He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story.\n- launchpad for the next step in your progress.\n- next steps\n- current status\n- any details\n- your intention\n- Share this Intermediate Packet with a friend, family member, colleague, or collaborator\n- Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important. By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.\n- Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost‚Äîonly saved for later use‚Äîgives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I‚Äôve wasted effort or that I‚Äôll lose the results of my thinking forever\n- sharing before I feel ready has completely altered the trajectory of my career.\n- Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time\n- Start by picking one project you want to move forward on\n- Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for the project. Start by writing out anything already on your mind, and then peruse your PARA categories for related notes and Intermediate Packets.\n- Move all the notes and IPs you might want to use into a new project folder.\n- Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the notes you‚Äôve gathered in front of you\n- If you find that you can‚Äôt complete the first iteration in one sitting, start by building a Hemingway Bridge to the next time you can work on it.\n- you feel resistance to continuing with this project later, try Dialing Down the Scope\n- Throughout every step of this process, be sure to keep notes on anything you learn or discover, or any new Intermediate Packets you might want to seek out.\n- Once you‚Äôre finished with your first iteration, have gathered feedback, and collected a new set of notes to work with, you‚Äôll be ready for whatever comes next\n- There is a certain level of organization that you want to maintain in your digital world, so that when you go there to get things done, your virtual workspaces support your productivity instead of interfering with it\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Cant-Hurt-Me":{"title":"","content":"# Can't Hurt Me\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication128/v4/a3/5b/2e/a35b2e27-11ed-a3e9-6709-937a4ee6743e/9781544512266.jpg/1400x2164w.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[David Goggins]]\n- Full Title: Can't Hurt Me\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- you‚Äôre probably living at about 40 percent of your true capability.\n  Damn shame.\n- anybody can become a totally different person and achieve what so-called experts like him claim is impossible, but it takes a lot of heart, will, and an armored mind.\n- when you have no confidence it becomes easy to value other people‚Äôs opinions, and I was valuing everyone‚Äôs opinion without considering the minds that generated them\n- Physical training is the perfect crucible to learn how to manage your thought process because when you‚Äôre working out, your focus is more likely to be single pointed, and your response to stress and pain is immediate and measurable\n- The reason it‚Äôs important to push hardest when you want to quit the most is because it helps you callous your mind.

These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.\n- Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work\n- Learning something complex like computer programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration on cognitively demanding concepts\n- To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work\n- To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you‚Äôre capable of producing‚Äîa task that requires depth.\n- But as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our population are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key currency‚Äîeven if most haven‚Äôt yet recognized this reality.\n- The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\n- Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.\n- More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people‚Äôs daily lives. I‚Äôm comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding skill\n- A deep life is a good life.\n- It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world‚Äôs best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time\n- to complete the project at hand. In this scenario, you‚Äôll probably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can service many more clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off.\n- talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There‚Äôs a premium to being the best\n- In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.\n- Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy\n  1. The ability to quickly master hard things.\n  2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.\n- This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn‚Äôt just necessary for working well with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar in just about any field\n- If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.

Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused\n- tightly on a specific skill you‚Äôre trying to improve or an idea you‚Äôre trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it‚Äôs most productive\n- Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused attention required by deliberate practice\n- neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people‚Äôs improvements on hard tasks\n- scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin‚Äîa layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner\n- To be great at something is to be well myelinated.\n- By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you‚Äôre forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation\n- This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits‚Äîeffectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it‚Äôs important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.\n- To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction\n- Give and Take\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches\n- High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)\n- Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn‚Äôt immediately follow‚Äîa residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.\n- the attention residue concept is still telling because it implies that the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance\n- To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

What about bill gates going to his cabin and coming up with a memo about the internet? Such generalizations dont work. Its easier to say, deep work doesnt guarantee greatness, or shallow work doesnt guarantee that youre a failure,\n      Edit: he does say this later\n- Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it‚Äôs possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare\n- big trends in business today actively decrease people‚Äôs ability to perform deep work\n- as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual‚Äôs efforts\n- None of these behaviors would survive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world.\n- The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the\n- bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.\n- To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it‚Äôs easier. There are at least two big reasons why this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your needs. If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier‚Äîat least, in the moment\n- The second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox\n- all the while feeling satisfyingly productive\n- name another example, consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They‚Äôre easier. For many, these standing meetings become a simple (but blunt) form of personal organization. Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them\n- to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible simulacrum of progress\n- The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. By doing so, this principle drives us toward shallow work in an economy that increasingly rewards depth.\n- I‚Äôm actively irresponsible.\n- A similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers. They want to prove that they‚Äôre productive members of the team and are earning their keep, but they‚Äôre not entirely clear what this goal constitutes\n- Knowledge workers, I‚Äôm arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value\n- Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.\n- Postman argued that our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it‚Äôs high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it‚Äôs good. Case closed.\n- In Morozov‚Äôs critique, we‚Äôve made ‚Äúthe Internet‚Äù synonymous with the revolutionary future of business and government.\n- The alternative, to not embrace all things Internet, is, as Postman would say, ‚Äúinvisible and therefore irrelevant.‚Äù\n- Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological\n- If you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in general, as it‚Äôs leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value production. But for you, as an individual, good news lurks. The myopia of your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage.\n- depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable\n- The goal of this chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much satisfaction in an information economy as it so clearly does in a craft economy. In the sections ahead, I‚Äôll make three arguments to support this claim. These arguments roughly follow a trajectory from the conceptually narrow to broad: starting with a neurological perspective, moving to the psychological, and ending with the philosophical.\n- The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.\n- what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore‚Äîplays in defining the quality of our life\n- Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to\n- Rapt\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.\n- Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.\n- Many knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting with these types of shallow concerns\n- this is a foolhardy way to go about your day, as it ensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your working life that‚Äôs dominated by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality.\n- when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what‚Äôs right\n- In work (and especially knowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you‚Äôll associate with your working life\n- I‚Äôll live the focused life, because it‚Äôs the best kind there is\n- Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience sampling method (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually feel about the beats of our daily lives.\n- The best moments usually occur when a person‚Äôs body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile\n- Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one‚Äôs work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.

This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else\n- This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).\n- The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity‚Äîthe state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day\n- To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.\n- the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits\n- Perhaps the biggest obstacle to implementing this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work require a flexibility that many fear they lack in their current positions.\n- people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are well defined and well advertised, and outside these stretches, you‚Äôre once again easy to find.\n- the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit\n- Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work\n- eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.\n- He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon pushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more morning depth.\n- The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.\n- The decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your self-control in such scheduling matters\n- it‚Äôs not just self-control issues that bias them toward the rhythmic philosophy, but also the reality that some jobs don‚Äôt allow you to disappear for days at a time when the need to go deep arises\n- This is likely the biggest reason why the rhythmic philosophy is one of the most common among deep workers in standard office jobs.\n- Isaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book\n- I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy\n- This approach is not for the deep work novice\n- Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves\n- This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities‚Äîa conviction that what you‚Äôre doing is important and will succeed. This type of conviction is typically built on a foundation of existing professional accomplishment\n- To write this book, for example, I had to take advantage of free stretches of time wherever they popped up. If my kids were taking a good nap, I‚Äôd grab my laptop and lock myself in the home office. If my wife wanted to visit her parents in nearby Annapolis on a weekend day, I‚Äôd take advantage of the extra child care to disappear to a quiet corner of their house to write. If a meeting at work was canceled, or an afternoon left open, I might retreat to one of my favorite libraries on campus to squeeze out a few hundred more words. And so on.\n- I instead tend to map out when I‚Äôll work deeply during each week at the beginning of the week, and then refine these decisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day\n- rarely haphazard in their work\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n- the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.\n- To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously\n- Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts\n- give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.\n- Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured\n- Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth\n- the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind‚Äôs instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.\n- William Shockley was scooped in the invention of the transistor\n- he locked himself in a hotel room in Chicago, where he had traveled ostensibly to attend a conference. He didn‚Äôt emerge from the room until he had ironed out the details for a better design that had been rattling around in his mind\n- Alan Lightman also leverages grand gestures. In his case, he retreats each summer to a ‚Äútiny island‚Äù in Maine to think deeply and recharge\n- She checked into a suite in the five-star Balmoral Hotel, located in the heart of downtown Edinburgh\n- He wrote during the whole flight to Japan, drank an espresso in the business class lounge once he arrived in Japan, then turned around and flew back, once again writing the whole way‚Äîarriving back in the States only thirty hours after he first left with a completed manuscript now in hand\n- The relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky\n- Dorsey justified the open layout of the Square headquarters by explaining: ‚ÄúWe encourage people to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity‚Äîand people walking by each other teaching new things.‚Äù\n- For the sake of discussion, let‚Äôs call this principle‚Äîthat when you allow people to bump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerge‚Äîthe theory of serendipitous creativity\n- This decision between promoting concentration and promoting serendipity seems to indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is incompatible with generating creative insights (a collaborative endeavor). This conclusion, however, is flawed\n- The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.\n- the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight‚Äîbe it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually‚Äîcan short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.\n- Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.\n- By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.\n- consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level. At the same time, don‚Äôt lionize this quest for interaction and positive randomness to the point where it crowds out the unbroken concentration ultimately required to wring something useful out of the swirl of ideas all around us.\n- this division between what and how is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world\n- The 4 Disciplines of Execution, which built on extensive consulting case studies to describe four ‚Äúdisciplines‚Äù (abbreviated, 4DX) for helping companies successfully implement high-level strategies. What struck me as I read was that this gap between what and how was relevant to my personal quest to spend more time working deeply.\n- For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.\n- If you want to win the war for attention, don‚Äôt try to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.‚Äù\n- The Art of Focus,‚Äù David Brooks\n- Once you‚Äôve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you‚Äôre ultimately trying to improve.\n- Lead measures, on the other hand, ‚Äúmeasure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.‚Äù\n- lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.\n- For an individual focused on deep work, it‚Äôs easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal\n- In the preceding discipline, I argued that for an individual focused on deep work, hours spent working deeply should be the lead measure. It follows, therefore, that the individual‚Äôs scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual‚Äôs current deep work hour count.\n- In multiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead\n- I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead\n- This strategy argues that you should follow Kreider‚Äôs lead by injecting regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done\n- Kreider‚Äôs buttercups, stink bugs, and stars.\n    - Tags: [[blue]] \n- There are many ways to accomplish this goal. You could, for example, use Kreider‚Äôs approach of retreating from the world of shallow tasks altogether by hiding out in an ‚Äúundisclosed location,‚Äù but this isn‚Äôt practical for most people. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning‚Äîno after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you‚Äôll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely\n- A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you‚Äôre engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.\n- attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate\n- To concentrate requires what ART calls directed attention. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you‚Äôll struggle to concentrate.\n- The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest\n- Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.\n- Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours‚Äîbut rarely more.\n- The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you‚Äôre careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday\n- Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won‚Äôt be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career\n- To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention\n- Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed\n- In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it‚Äôs captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you‚Äôre done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, ‚ÄúShutdown complete‚Äù). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it‚Äôs safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.\n- The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there‚Äôs a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect\n- This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention\n- The shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the Zeigarnik effect. While it doesn‚Äôt force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in your task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force you to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day. This ritual ensures that no task will be forgotten: Each will be reviewed daily and tackled when the time is appropriate. Your mind, in other words, is released from its duty to keep track of these obligations at every moment‚Äîyour shutdown ritual has taken over that responsibility.\n- Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you‚Äôre done, be done\n- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained\n- Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don‚Äôt simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction\n- If every moment of potential boredom in your life‚Äîsay, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives‚Äîis relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the ‚Äúmental wrecks‚Äù in Nass‚Äôs research, it‚Äôs not ready for deep work‚Äîeven if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.\n- The strategies that follow are motivated by the key idea that getting the most out of your deep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction\n- I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction\n- Schedule in advance when you‚Äôll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the next time you‚Äôre allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed‚Äîno matter how tempting.\n- The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain‚Äôs ability to focus. It‚Äôs instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.\n- The key here isn‚Äôt to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.\n  One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when you‚Äôre forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It‚Äôs crucial in these situations that if you‚Äôre in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it‚Äôs incredibly valuable\n- To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it‚Äôs sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy proposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy.\n- identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that‚Äôs high on your priority list. Estimate how long you‚Äôd normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline‚Äîfor example, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect it. If this isn‚Äôt possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by setting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can‚Äôt avoid seeing it as you work.\n  At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity\n- always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility\n- Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable\n- Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve‚Äîproviding, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain.\n- The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you‚Äôre occupied physically but not mentally‚Äîwalking, jogging, driving, showering‚Äîand focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.\n- I suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own life. You don‚Äôt necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal should be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical week. Fortunately, finding time for this strategy is easy, as it takes advantage of periods that would otherwise be wasted (such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work\n- When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back\n- When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it\n- When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step.\n- In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process\n- review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory\n- define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables\n- the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified\n- This cycle of reviewing and storing variables, identifying and tackling the next-step question, then consolidating your gains is like an intense workout routine for your concentration ability\n- Moonwalking with Einstein\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- idea that a drastic Internet sabbatical* is the only alternative to the distraction generated by social media and infotainment has increasingly pervaded our cultural conversation.\n- The problem with this binary response to this issue is that these two choices are much too crude to be useful.\n- Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them. There‚Äôs no reason why knowledge workers cannot do the same when it comes to the Internet‚Äîthe fact that the skilled labor here now involves digital bits doesn‚Äôt change this reality.\n- The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts\n- Identifying what matters most in your life, and then attempting to assess the impacts of various tools on these factors, doesn‚Äôt reduce to a simple formula‚Äîthis task requires practice and experimentation\n- The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life\n- Once you‚Äôve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.\n- These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other hand, they should be general enough that they‚Äôre not tied to a onetime outcome\n- The next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use.\n- ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact on your regular\n- Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.\n- The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.\n- If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you‚Äôre taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It‚Äôs a zero-sum game. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit.\n- As I learned in the decade that followed, a period in which I patiently and painstakingly built an audience for my current blog, Study Hacks, from a handful of readers to hundreds of thousands per month, is that earning people‚Äôs attention online is hard, hard work.\n- Bennett writes in his 1910 self-help classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day\n    - Tags: [[purple]] \n- Bennett suggests that his typical man see his sixteen free hours as a ‚Äúday within a day,‚Äù explaining, ‚Äúduring those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income.\n- to perform rigorous self-improvement\n- should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work, remains relevant today\n- Put more thought into your leisure time\n- this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don‚Äôt default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your ‚Äúday within a day.‚Äù\n- It‚Äôs crucial, therefore, that you figure out in advance what you‚Äôre going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin. Structured hobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your time.\n- What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change‚Äînot rest, except in sleep.\n- The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. For most businesses, if you eliminated significant amounts of this shallowness, their bottom line would likely remain unaffected\n- The strategies that follow are designed to help you ruthlessly identify the shallowness in your current schedule, then cull it down to minimum levels‚Äîleaving more time for the deep efforts that ultimately matter most\n- a nontrivial amount of shallow work is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs\n- we should see the goal of this rule as taming shallow work‚Äôs footprint in your schedule, not eliminating it\n- cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities\n- The implication is that once you‚Äôve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you‚Äôll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more\n- Shallow work, therefore, doesn‚Äôt become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day\n- treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated\n- We spend much of our day on autopilot‚Äînot giving much thought to what we‚Äôre doing with our time. This is a problem.\n- adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, ‚ÄúWhat makes the most sense right now?\n- Schedule every minute of your day.\n- At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks. For\n- you can batch similar things into more generic task blocks.\n- You have, in effect, given every minute of your workday a job.\n- Two things can (and likely will) go wrong with your schedule once the day progresses\n- The first is that your estimates will prove wrong\n- your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day\n- If you find that schedule revisions become overwhelming in their frequency, there are a few tactics that can inject some more stability. First, you should recognize that almost definitely you‚Äôre going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things.\n- The second tactic that helps is the use of overflow conditional blocks. If you‚Äôre not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it.\n- The third tactic I suggest is to be liberal with your use of task blocks. Deploy many throughout your day and make them longer than required to handle the tasks you plan in the morning\n- I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day\n- Decide in advance what you‚Äôre going to do with every minute of your workday. It‚Äôs natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it‚Äôs undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.\n- fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration\n- : Radhika Nagpal, the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed.\n- Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal\n- In turning down obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almost as much of my schedule\n- To summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in academia without Tom-style overload due to two reasons. First, we‚Äôre asymmetric in the culling forced by our fixed-schedule commitment. By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the limits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits, also leading to more value produced as compared to longer but less organized schedules\n- call.‚Äù A commitment to fixed-schedule productivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set\n- Fixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a meta-habit that‚Äôs simple to adopt but broad in its impact\n- The process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the impact of this technology on your time and attention. There are two reasons for this effect. First, it reduces the number of e-mails in your inbox\n- Second, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric message immediately ‚Äúcloses the loop‚Äù with respect to the project at hand.\n- Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you‚Äôre spending more time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this point will save you many more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later.\n- Their default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to not respond.\n- it‚Äôs the sender‚Äôs responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile\n- There‚Äôs also no way to avoid that some bad things will happen if you take this approach\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Die-With-Zero":{"title":"","content":"# Die With Zero\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication114/v4/b2/8b/1b/b28b1b76-5290-e6dc-7af7-3d9c244a45a3/9780358100515_marketingimage.jpg/1400x2105w.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Bill Perkins]]\n- Full Title: Die With Zero\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- When the end is near, we suddenly start thinking, What the hell am I doing? Why did I wait this long? Until then, most of us go through life as if we had all the time in the world.\n- it makes no sense to let opportunities pass us by for fear of squandering our money. Squandering our lives should be a much greater worry.\n- our ability to enjoy different kinds of experiences changes throughout our lifetimes.\n- It‚Äôs called consumption smoothing. Our incomes might vary from one month or one year to another, but that doesn‚Äôt mean our spending should reflect those variations‚Äîwe would be better off if we evened out those variations.\n- Life energy is all the hours that you‚Äôre alive to do things‚Äîand whenever you work, you spend some of that finite life energy\n- Living on a shoestring when you can afford more deprives you of those experiences and makes your world smaller than it needs to be\n- His name is Chris Renna and he works at a clinic called Life¬≠Span that does super-comprehensive testing to catch problems early\n- Those are the people I‚Äôm writing for‚Äîpeople who are\n- saving too much for their own good.\n- The business of life is the acquisition of memories. In the end that‚Äôs all there is.\n- you retire on your memories\n- To fully enjoy life instead of just surviving it, you need to stop driving mindlessly and actively steer your life the way you want it to go\n- Once you‚Äôre in the habit of working for money to live, the thrill of making money exceeds the thrill of actually living.\n- So many people feel like they can never get enough, and as their net worth grows, their goalposts just keep shifting\n- If you spend hours and hours of your life acquiring money and then die without spending all of that money, then you‚Äôve needlessly wasted too many precious hours of your life.\n- the Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)‚Äîan idea about how people manage their spending and saving to try to get the most from their money across their life span\n- Even people who see work as a form of play would be better off if they spent at least some percentage of their time on experiences that don‚Äôt involve working for money.\n- Because even if you enjoyed every minute of the work that brought you that money, failing to spend that money is still a waste.\n- most people keep accumulating wealth for decades, and most don‚Äôt start spending it down until very late in life\n- the more risk you are willing to take, the less of your life energy you‚Äôre likely to waste working for money you won‚Äôt ever get to spend.\n- If you live your life with fear and\n- avoidance, my bet is you will either fritter your money away or play it so safe that you will leave many, many years of your hard-earned money behind‚Äîso you‚Äôll be working many years as a slave to your own fears.\n- We are solving for your total life enjoyment.\n- They gave up years of their life while healthy and vibrant to buy a few extra weeks of life when they are sick and immobile. If that‚Äôs not irrational, I don‚Äôt know what is!\n- Start thinking more about how you use your limited time, your life energy, and you‚Äôll be well on your way to living the fullest life you possibly can.\n- Putting your kids first means you give to them much earlier, and you make a deliberate plan to make sure that what you have for your children reaches them when it will make the most impact.\n- What if he‚Äôd had a particularly costly disease, like Alz¬≠heimer‚Äôs, which typically requires expensive long-term care? Wouldn‚Äôt he have needed his savings for that? As noted earlier, if that‚Äôs the main reason you feel compelled to keep saving and saving, remember that you can buy long-term care insurance, which costs far less than self-insuring by saving massive amounts of money for a crisis that may never come. Just like any other kind of insurance.\n- many of us are too busy chasing x, y, and z for the sake of future benefits, not realizing that the time to have meaningful experiences with our children is now. But\n- Of all the experiences you are trying to bequeath to your child, one of those experiences is time with you.\n- So many people tell themselves that they are working for their kids‚Äîthey just blindly assume that earning more money will benefit their kids. But until you stop to think about the numbers, you can‚Äôt know whether sacrificing your time to earn more money will result in a net benefit for your children.\n- If you plan to give, give while you‚Äôre alive, and the earlier the better. Your charity can‚Äôt wait.\n- strike the right balance between spending on the present (and only on what you value) and saving smartly for the future.\n- You want to achieve the optimal balance between enjoying the present and providing for a good future.\n- travel is the ultimate gauge of a person‚Äôs ability to extract enjoyment from money, because it takes time, money, and, above all, health.\n- Your ability to enjoy many experiences in life depends on your health‚Äîbut money plays a part, too, because a lot of activities cost money. So you‚Äôd better spend the money when you still have the health.\n- The utility, or usefulness, of money declines with age.\n- It makes sense to spend more of your money at some ages than others, so it makes sense to adjust your balance of spending to saving over the years accordingly.\n- There is a time to work (and save) and a time to play, and the optimal life requires planning for both survival and thriving.\n- Think about the three basics people need to have to get the most out of life: health, free time, and money. The problem is that these things rarely all come together at once.\n- So people in these middle years‚Äîneither very young nor very old‚Äîtypically have a different problem: They face a time crunch, especially if they have children at home.\n- Not that children don‚Äôt bring plenty of positive life experiences‚Äîthey do‚Äîbut between changing diapers, driving to various lessons and practices, and taking care of a larger household, there‚Äôs just less time for other experiences.\n- People in the middle years sometimes trade money for time‚Äîand the more money they have, the more of it they should be using to buy time\n- no amount of money can ever make up for very poor health\n- When the demanding job finally brings you financial success, do you still have the key ingredient (health) for enjoying that success?\n- What I‚Äôm really trying to get across is that improved health improves everything in your life, makes every experience more enjoyable, at every age.\n- Basically, there is a compounding effect to being in poor health.\n- People of all ages should be spending more time and money on their health\n- The other big opportunity I see for creating a more balanced life is to exchange money for free time‚Äîa tactic that usually has the most\n- impact in one‚Äôs middle years, when you have more money than time.\n- time is a lot more scarce and finite than your cash\n- Using time-saving services reduced time pressure, they found, and reduced time pressure improved the day‚Äôs mood. If done repeatedly, such daily mood lifts improve overall life satisfaction.\n- You just kind of assume that some things will last forever. But of course, they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs sad, granted, but there‚Äôs good news: Just realizing that they don‚Äôt last forever, that everything eventually fades and dies, can make you appreciate everything more in the here and now.\n- the top regret among Ware‚Äôs male patients‚Äîwas this: ‚ÄúI wish I had not worked so hard.‚Äù\n- Being aware that your time is limited can clearly motivate you to make the most of the time you do have.\n- We all have dreams in life, but I have found that it‚Äôs extremely helpful to actually write them all down in a list.\n- Then, once you have your list of items, start to drop each of your hoped-for pursuits into the specific buckets, based on when you‚Äôd ideally have each experience.\n- The point is, today‚Äôs the day to start actively and consciously thinking and planning for your years ahead.\n- you might begin to sense that some desired experiences conflict with other experiences. Or you might realize that some of the activities you want to do won‚Äôt happen at all unless you begin to plan for them now.\n- by dividing goals into time buckets, you are taking a much more proactive approach to your life.\n- convert your life energy to as many experience points as you can. Doing that requires figuring out the optimal allocation of your money and free time to the right ages, given the inevitability of declining health and eventual death\n- survival threshold = 0.7 √ó (cost to live one year) √ó (years left to live)\n- when you think of your net worth peak this way, the peak is not a number (a specific dollar amount) but a specific date (tied to your biological age).\n- much earlier than what is traditionally recommended. If you wait until you‚Äôre 65 or even 62 to dip into your nest egg, you will almost certainly end up working longer than necessary for money you will never get to spend. What a sad thought: to slave away at a job and never get the gold.\n- What, do you really expect me to quit a job I love just because I‚Äôve hit some magical date?‚Äù And my answer is no. If you want to keep working, be my guest. Just be sure to ramp up your spending accordingly so that you don‚Äôt end up dying with lots of money left over. That would be a waste no matter how much you enjoyed your job.\n- the vast majority of the experiences you want to have will have to happen within about 20 years of midlife, in either direction‚Äîin other words, roughly between 20 and 60.\n- For people used to accumulating wealth, decumulation doesn‚Äôt come naturally. Old habits die hard.\n- So before you quit or scale back your job, really think through what you want to do once your work won‚Äôt be taking up much of your everyday time.\n- Remember: In the end, the business of life is the acquisition of memories.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Four-Thousand-Weeks":{"title":"","content":"# Four Thousand Weeks\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-6.71d9a01814f7.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Burkeman, Oliver]]\n- Full Title: Four Thousand Weeks\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- the modern discipline known as time management‚Äîlike its hipper cousin, productivity‚Äîis a depressingly narrow-minded affair, focused on how to crank through as many work tasks as possible\n- Assuming you live to be eighty, you‚Äôll have had about four thousand weeks.\n- this book is an attempt to help redress the balance‚Äîto see if we can‚Äôt discover, or recover, some ways of thinking about time that do justice to our real situation: to the outrageous brevity and shimmering possibilities of our four thousand weeks.\n- busyness has been rebranded as ‚Äúhustle\n- the pressure to fit ever-increasing quantities of activity into a stubbornly nonincreasing quantity of daily time.\n- obstreperous\n    - Tags: [[blue]] \n- busyness becomes an emblem of prestige\n- Which is clearly completely absurd: for almost the whole of history, the entire point of being rich was not having to work so much\n- We sense that there are important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can‚Äôt say exactly what they are\n- This yearning for more meaning can take many forms\n- instance, in the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause\n- feeling of frustration at having to work a day job in order to buy slivers of time for the work you love\n- spend more of your brief time on earth with your kids, in nature\n- And this feeling of wrongness is only exacerbated by our attempts to become more productive, which seem to have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff ever further over the horizon\n- news.\n- The real problem‚Äîor so I hope to convince you‚Äîis that we‚Äôve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by, a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse\n- Each hour or week or year is like a container being carried on the belt, which we must fill as it passes, if we‚Äôre to feel that we‚Äôre making good use of our time\n- Historians call this way of living ‚Äútask orientation,‚Äù because the rhythms of life emerge organically from the tasks themselves, rather than from being lined up against an abstract timeline\n- The medieval farmer simply had no reason to adopt such a bizarre idea in the first place\n- Living this way, one can imagine that experience would have felt expansive and fluid, suffused with something it might not be an exaggeration to call a kind of magic.\n- the feeling of timelessness that Richard Rohr, a contemporary Franciscan priest and author, calls ‚Äúliving in deep time.\n- From thinking about time in the abstract, it‚Äôs natural to start treating it as a resource\n- Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it\n- well, and to berate yourself when you feel you‚Äôve wasted it\n- When you‚Äôre faced with too many demands, it‚Äôs easy to assume that the only answer must be to make better use of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working for longer‚Äîas if you were a machine in the Industrial Revolution‚Äîinstead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n- The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it‚Äôs impossible ever to feel as though you‚Äôre doing well enough\n- The trouble with attempting to master your time, it turns out, is that time ends up mastering you\n- Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself\n- You‚Äôll do what you can, you won‚Äôt do what you can‚Äôt, and the tyrannical inner voice insisting that you must do everything is simply mistaken.\n- We would be forced to acknowledge that there are hard choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to disappoint, which cherished ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail at. Maybe you can‚Äôt keep your current job while also seeing enough of your children; maybe making sufficient time in the week for your creative calling means you‚Äôll never have an especially tidy home, or get quite as much exercise as you should, and so on\n- The general principle in operation is one you might call the ‚Äúefficiency trap.‚Äù Rendering yourself more efficient‚Äîeither by implementing various productivity techniques or by driving yourself harder‚Äîwon‚Äôt generally result in the feeling of having ‚Äúenough time,‚Äù because, all else being equal, the demands will increase to offset any benefits. Far from getting things done, you‚Äôll be creating new things to do.\n- the only route to psychological freedom is to let go of the limit-denying fantasy of getting it all done and instead to focus on doing a few things that count.\n- Think of it as ‚Äúexistential overwhelm‚Äù: the modern world provides an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and so there arises an inevitable and unbridgeable gap between what you‚Äôd ideally like to do and what you actually can do.\n- the world has an effectively infinite number of experiences to offer, so getting a handful of them under your belt brings you no closer to a sense of having feasted on life‚Äôs possibilities.\n- The more wonderful experiences you succeed in having, the more additional wonderful experiences you start to feel you could have, or ought to have, on top of all those you‚Äôve already had, with the result that the feeling of existential overwhelm gets worse.\n- The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you‚Äôll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n- resist the urge to consume more and more experiences, since that strategy can only lead to the feeling of having even more experiences left to consume.\n- focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for\n- instead of clearing the decks, declining to clear the decks, focusing instead on what‚Äôs truly of greatest consequence while tolerating the discomfort of knowing that, as you do\n- so, the decks will be filling up further, with emails and errands and other to-dos, many of which you may never get around to at all\n- Convenience culture seduces us into imagining that we might find room for everything important by eliminating only life‚Äôs tedious tasks. But it‚Äôs a lie. You have to choose a few things, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results\n- The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.\n- Principle number one is to pay yourself first when it comes to time\n- if a certain activity really matters to you‚Äîa creative project, say, though it could just as easily be nurturing a relationship, or activism in the service of some cause‚Äîthe only way to be sure it will happen is to do some of it today, no matter how little, and no matter how many other genuinely big rocks may be begging for your attention\n- protect your time by scheduling ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù with yourself\n- The second principle is to limit your work in progress\n- fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you allow yourself to work on at any given time\n- three items\n- It‚Äôs also permissible to free up a slot by abandoning a project altogether if it isn‚Äôt working out. The point isn‚Äôt to force yourself to finish absolutely everything you start, but rather to banish the bad habit of keeping an ever-proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back burner.\n- I found myself effortlessly breaking down my projects into manageable chunks\n- of my three tasks in progress, it would clog up the system for months, so I was naturally motivated to figure out the next achievable step in each case instead.\n- The third principle is to resist the allure of middling priorities\n- You need to learn how to start saying no to things you do want to do, with the recognition that you have only one life.‚Äù\n- We invariably prefer indecision over committing ourselves to a single path\n- it‚Äôs easy for me to fantasize about, say, a life spent achieving stellar professional success, while also excelling as a parent and partner, while also dedicating myself to training for marathons or lengthy meditation retreats or volunteering in my community‚Äîbecause so long as I‚Äôm only fantasizing, I get to imagine all of them unfolding simultaneously and flawlessly. As soon as I start trying to live any of those lives, though, I‚Äôll be forced to make trade-offs‚Äîto put less time than I‚Äôd like into one of those domains, so as to make space for another‚Äîand to accept that nothing I do will go perfectly anyway, with the result that my actual life will inevitably prove disappointing by comparison with the fantasy.\n- settling is unavoidable but also because living life to the fullest requires settling. ‚ÄúYou must settle, in a relatively enduring way, upon something that will be the object of your striving, in order for that striving to count as striving,‚Äù\n- there‚Äôs no possibility of a romantic relationship being truly fulfilling unless you‚Äôre willing, at least for a while, to settle for that specific relationship, with all its imperfections\n- And not only should you settle; ideally, you should settle in a way that makes it harder to back out, such as moving in together, or getting married, or having a child\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n- When you can no longer turn back, anxiety falls away, because now there‚Äôs only one direction to travel: forward into the consequences of your choice\n- what you pay attention to will define, for you, what reality is.\n- Hofstadter‚Äôs law,‚Äù which states that any task you‚Äôre planning to tackle will always take longer than you expect, ‚Äúeven when you take into account Hofstadter‚Äôs Law\n- The trouble with being so emotionally invested in planning for the future, though, is that while it may occasionally prevent a catastrophe, the rest of the time it tends to exacerbate the very anxiety it was supposed to allay.\n- the struggle for control over the future is a stark example of our refusal to acknowledge our built-in limitations when it comes to time\n- a surprisingly effective antidote to anxiety can be to simply realize that this demand for reassurance from the future is one that will definitely never be satisfied\n- despite our total lack of control over any of these occurrences, each of us made it through to this point in our lives‚Äîso it might at least be worth entertaining the possibility that when the uncontrollable future arrives, we‚Äôll have what it takes to weather that as well.\n- Then Krishnamurti ‚Äúsaid in a soft, almost shy voice, ‚ÄòYou see, I don‚Äôt mind what happens.‚Äô‚Äù\n- We treat everything we‚Äôre doing‚Äîlife itself, in other words‚Äîas valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else.\n- So intently were they focused on using their time for a future benefit‚Äîfor the ability to revisit or share the experience later on‚Äîthat they were barely experiencing the exhibition itself at all\n- The writer Adam Gopnik calls the trap into which I had fallen the ‚Äúcausal catastrophe,‚Äù which he defines as the belief ‚Äúthat the proof of the rightness or wrongness of some way of bringing up children is the kind of adults it produces.\n- we should therefore try to treat every such experience with the reverence we‚Äôd show if it were the final instance of it\n- One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters‚Äîthe earth‚Äôs resources, your time and abilities (or ‚Äúhuman resources‚Äù)‚Äîin the service of future profit\n- But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase.\n- Our obsession with extracting the greatest future value out of our time blinds us to the reality that, in fact, the moment of truth is always now‚Äîthat life is nothing but a succession of present moments, culminating in death, and that you‚Äôll probably never get to a point where you feel you have things in perfect working order. And that therefore you had better stop postponing the ‚Äúreal meaning‚Äù of your existence into the future, and throw yourself into life now.\n- By trying too hard to make the most of his time, he misses his life.\n- A more fruitful approach to the challenge of living more fully in the moment starts from noticing that you are, in fact, always already\n- living in the moment anyway, whether you like it or not\n- Aristotle argued that true leisure‚Äîby which he meant self-reflection and philosophical contemplation‚Äîwas among the very highest of virtues because it was worth choosing for its own sake,\n- leisure no longer feels very leisurely\n- workers were offered a deal: you could do whatever you liked with your time off, so long as it didn‚Äôt damage‚Äîand preferably enhanced‚Äîyour usefulness on the job\n- maverick Marxist Paul Lafargue would later call, in the title of his best-known pamphlet, The Right To Be Lazy.\n- In order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth\n- To rest for the sake of rest‚Äîto enjoy a lazy hour for its own sake‚Äîentails first accepting the fact that this is it: that your days aren‚Äôt progressing toward a future state of perfectly invulnerable happiness, and that to approach them with such an assumption is systematically to drain our four thousand weeks of their value\n- digital sabbath\n- The other important thing we can do as individuals, in order to enter the experience of genuine rest, is simply to stop expecting it to feel good, at least in the first instance\n- is initially going to provoke some serious feelings of discomfort, rather than of delight. That discomfort isn‚Äôt a sign that you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it, though. It‚Äôs a sign that you definitely should.\n- Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an ‚Äúatelic activity,‚Äù meaning that its value isn‚Äôt derived from its telos, or ultimate aim\n- when your relationship with time is almost entirely instrumental, the present moment starts to lose its meaning. And it makes sense that this feeling might strike in the form of a midlife crisis, because midlife is when many of us first become consciously aware that mortality is approaching‚Äîand mortality makes it impossible to ignore the absurdity of living solely for the future.\n- delightful experience in the present moment, and that has to be weighed in the balance; it can‚Äôt be the case that concerns for the future must always automatically take precedence\n- Because children grow up, we think a child‚Äôs purpose is to grow up,‚Äù Herzen says. ‚ÄúBut a child‚Äôs purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn‚Äôt disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment¬†‚Ä¶ Life‚Äôs bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.‚Äù\n- nineteenth-century Russian philosopher Alexander Herzen\n- our lives, thanks to their finitude, are inevitably full of activities that we‚Äôre doing for the very last time\n- To treat all these moments solely as stepping-stones to some future moment is to demonstrate a level of obliviousness to our real situation that would be jaw-dropping if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that we all do it, all the time.\n- We might seek to incorporate into our daily lives more things we do for their own sake alone‚Äîto spend some of our time, that is, on activities in which the only thing we‚Äôre trying to get from them is the doing itself\n- the more you focus on using time well, the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through, en route to some calmer, better, more fulfilling point in the future, which never actually arrives. The problem is one of instrumentalization\n- As the world gets faster and faster, we come to believe that our happiness, or our financial survival, depends on our being able to work and move and make things happen at superhuman speed\n- We grow anxious about not keeping up‚Äîso to quell the anxiety, to try to achieve the feeling that our lives are under control, we move faster. But this only generates an addictive spiral. We push ourselves harder to get rid of anxiety, but the result is actually more anxiety, because the faster we go, the clearer it becomes that we‚Äôll never succeed in getting ourselves or the rest of the world to move as fast as we feel is necessary\n- speed addiction tends to be socially celebrated. Your friends are more likely to praise you for being ‚Äúdriven.\n- You surrender to the reality that things just take the time they take, and that you can‚Äôt quiet your anxieties by working faster, because it isn‚Äôt within your power to force reality‚Äôs pace as much as you feel you need to, and because the faster you go, the faster you‚Äôll feel you need to go\n- second-order change,‚Äù meaning that it‚Äôs not an incremental improvement but a change in perspective that reframes everything\n- When you finally face the truth that you can‚Äôt dictate how fast things go, you stop trying to outrun your anxiety, and your anxiety is transformed. Digging in to a challenging work project that can‚Äôt be hurried becomes not a trigger for stressful emotions but a bracing act of choice; giving a difficult novel the time it demands becomes a source of relish\n- you begin to acquire what has become the least fashionable but perhaps most consequential of superpowers: patience.\n- In a world geared for hurry, the capacity to resist the urge to hurry‚Äîto allow things to take the time they take‚Äîis a way to gain purchase on the world, to do the work that counts, and to derive satisfaction from the doing itself, instead of deferring all your fulfillment to the future.\n- snap at our partners, rather than hearing them out, because waiting and listening would make us feel‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîas though we weren‚Äôt in control of the situation. Or we abandon difficult creative projects, or nascent romantic relationships, because there‚Äôs less uncertainty in just calling things off than in waiting to see how they might develop\n- The first is to develop a taste for having problems\n- The second principle is to embrace radical incrementalism\n- the most productive and successful among them generally made writing a smaller part of their daily routine than the others, so that it was much more feasible to keep going with it day after day\n- They cultivated the patience to tolerate the fact that they probably wouldn‚Äôt be producing very much on any individual day, with the result that they produced much more over the long term. They wrote in brief daily sessions‚Äîsometimes as short as ten minutes, and never longer\n- than four hours‚Äîand they religiously took weekends off\n- One critical aspect of the radical incrementalist approach, which runs counter to much mainstream advice on productivity, is thus to be willing to stop when your daily time is up, even when you‚Äôre bursting with energy and feel as though you could get much more done. If you‚Äôve decided to work on a given project for fifty minutes, then once fifty minutes have elapsed, get up and walk away from it\n- Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again and again, and thus to sustain your productivity over an entire career\n- The final principle is that, more often than not, originality lies on the far side of unoriginality\n- time is also a ‚Äúnetwork good,‚Äù one that derives its value from how many other people have access to it, too, and how well their portion is coordinated with yours\n- having all the time in the world isn‚Äôt much use if you‚Äôre forced to experience it all on your own.\n- Rest is permissible, but only for the purposes of recuperation for work, or perhaps for some other form of self-improvement. It becomes difficult to enjoy a moment of rest for itself alone, without regard for any potential future benefits, because rest that has no instrumental value feels wasteful.\n- In order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth\n- What would it mean to spend the only time you ever get in a way that truly feels as though you are making it count?\n- the number of lives you‚Äôd need in order to span the whole of civilization, sixty, was ‚Äúthe number of friends I squeeze into my living room when I have a drinks party.‚Äù From this perspective, human history hasn‚Äôt unfolded glacially but in the blink of an eye. And it follows, of course, that your own life will have been a minuscule little flicker of near-nothingness in the scheme of things\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n    - Note: This makes no sense. If 60 lifetimes is the whole of civiliation, then each lifetime really counts\n- what you do with your life doesn‚Äôt matter all that much‚Äîand when it comes to how you‚Äôre using your finite time, the universe absolutely could not care less.\n    - Note: While true, this is in contrast to Frankl‚Äôs Mans search for meaning. Finding meaning in your life does matter however cosmically insignificant.\n- If you had a more realistic sense of your own sheer irrelevance, considered on the timescale of the universe, you‚Äôd probably be less motivated to struggle to survive, and thereby to propagate your genes\n- But what actually happens is that this overvaluing of your existence gives rise to an unrealistic definition of what it would mean to use your finite time well. It sets the bar much too high\n- No wonder it comes as a relief to be reminded of your insignificance: it‚Äôs the feeling of realizing that you‚Äôd been holding yourself, all this time, to standards you couldn‚Äôt reasonably\n- be expected to meet. And this realization isn‚Äôt merely calming but liberating, because once you‚Äôre no longer burdened by such an unrealistic definition of a ‚Äúlife well spent,‚Äù you‚Äôre freed to consider the possibility that a far wider variety of things might qualify as meaningful ways to use your finite time. You‚Äôre freed, too, to consider the possibility that many of the things you‚Äôre already doing with it are more meaningful than you‚Äôd supposed‚Äîand that until now, you‚Äôd subconsciously been devaluing them, on the grounds that they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù enough.\n- Truly doing justice to the astonishing gift of a few thousand weeks isn‚Äôt a matter of resolving to ‚Äúdo something remarkable‚Äù with them. In fact, it entails precisely the opposite: refusing to hold them to an abstract and overdemanding standard of\n- remarkableness, against which they can only ever be found wanting, and taking them instead on their own terms, dropping back down from godlike fantasies of cosmic significance into the experience of life as it concretely, finitely‚Äîand often enough, marvelously‚Äîreally is.\n- And we chase the ultimate fantasy of time mastery‚Äîthe desire, by the time we die, to have truly mattered in the cosmic scheme of things, as opposed to being instantly trampled underfoot by the advancing eons.\n- your quantity of time is so limited, you‚Äôll never reach the commanding position of being able to handle every demand that might be thrown at you or pursue every ambition that feels important; you‚Äôll be obliged to make tough choices instead\n- Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire\n- Entering space and time completely\n- There is a sort of cruelty, Iddo Landau points out, in holding yourself to standards nobody could ever reach (and which many of us would never dream of demanding of other people). The more humane approach is to drop such efforts as completely as you can. Let your impossible standards crash to the ground. Then pick a few meaningful tasks from the rubble and get started on them today.\n- By contrast, the individual path ‚Äúis the way you make for yourself, which is never prescribed, which you do not know in advance, and which simply comes into being itself when you put one foot in front of the other.‚Äù His sole advice for walking such a path was to ‚Äúquietly do the next and most necessary thing. So long as you think you don‚Äôt yet know what that is, you still have too much money to spend in useless speculation.\n- Do the next right thing,\n- Any strategy for limiting your work in progress will help here (here), but perhaps the simplest is to keep two to-do lists, one ‚Äúopen‚Äù and one ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù The open list is for everything that‚Äôs on your plate and will doubtless be nightmarishly long. Fortunately, it‚Äôs not your job to tackle it: instead, feed tasks from the open list to the closed one‚Äîthat is, a list with a fixed number of entries, ten at most. The rule is that you can‚Äôt add a new task until one‚Äôs completed. (You may also require a third list, for tasks that are ‚Äúon hold‚Äù until someone else gets back to you.) You‚Äôll never get through all the tasks on the open list‚Äîbut you were never going to in any case, and at least this way you‚Äôll complete plenty of things you genuinely care about.\n- A complementary strategy is to establish predetermined time boundaries for your daily work\n- focus on one big project at a time\n- strategic underachievement‚Äîthat is, nominating in advance whole areas of life in which you won‚Äôt expect excellence of yourself\n- there‚Äôs scope to fail on a cyclical basis: to aim to do the bare minimum at work for the next two months\n- As a counterstrategy, keep a ‚Äúdone list,‚Äù which starts empty first thing in the morning, and which you then gradually fill with whatever you accomplish through the day.\n- consciously pick your battles in charity, activism, and politics: to decide that your spare time\n- choose devices with only one purpose\n- pay more attention to every moment, however mundane: to find novelty not by doing radically different things but by plunging more deeply into the life you already have. Experience life with twice the usual intensity, and ‚Äúyour experience of life would be twice as full as it currently is‚Äù‚Äîand any period of life would be remembered as having lasted twice as long. Meditation helps here. But so does going on unplanned walks to see where they lead you, using a different route to get to work, taking up photography or birdwatching or nature drawing or journaling, playing ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù with a child: anything that draws your attention more fully into what you‚Äôre doing in the present.\n- deliberately adopting an attitude of curiosity, in which your goal isn‚Äôt to achieve any particular outcome, or successfully explain your position, but, as Hobson puts it, ‚Äúto figure out who this human being is that we‚Äôre with\n- money, check in on a friend, send an email praising someone‚Äôs work‚Äîact on the impulse right away, rather than putting it off until later\n- So training yourself to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù really means training yourself to resist the urge to manipulate your experience or the people and things in the world around you‚Äîto let things be as they are\n- Do Nothing‚Äù meditation, for which the instructions are to simply set a timer, probably only for five or ten minutes at first; sit down in a chair; and then stop trying to do anything\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Give-and-Take":{"title":"","content":"# Give and Take\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication118/v4/9f/ce/d4/9fced421-5687-1724-6391-62716d446f47/9780297869825.jpg/1400x0w.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Adam Grant]]\n- Full Title: Give and Take\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- According to conventional wisdom, highly successful people have three things in common: motivation, ability, and opportunity. If we want to succeed, we need a combination of hard work, talent, and luck\n- one that‚Äôs critical but often neglected: success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people\n- do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?\n- two kinds of people who fall at opposite ends of the reciprocity spectrum at work\n- Takers have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give. They tilt reciprocity in their own favor, putting their own interests ahead of others‚Äô needs\n- giver. In the workplace, givers are a relatively rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them\n- If you‚Äôre a giver at work, you simply strive to be generous in sharing your time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections with other people who can benefit from them.\n- people. If you‚Äôre a taker, you help others strategically, when the benefits to you outweigh the personal costs\n- Professionally, few of us act purely like givers or takers, adopting a third style instead. We become matchers, striving to preserve an equal balance of giving and getting. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you‚Äôre a matcher, you believe in tit for tat, and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors\n- Giving, taking, and matching are three fundamental styles of social interaction, but the lines between them aren‚Äôt hard and fast\n- Research demonstrates that givers sink to the bottom of the success ladder. Across a wide range of important occupations, givers are at a disadvantage: they make others better off but sacrifice their own success in the process.\n- Going out of their way to help others prevented them from getting their own work done.\n- compared with takers and matchers, givers brought in two and a half times less annual sales revenue\n- There‚Äôs even evidence that compared with takers, on average, givers earn 14 percent less money, have twice the risk of becoming victims of crimes, and are judged as 22 percent less powerful and dominant\n- So if givers are most likely to land at the bottom of the success ladder, who‚Äôs at the top‚Äîtakers or matchers?\n- It‚Äôs the givers again.\n- The worst performers and the best performers are givers; takers and matchers are more likely to land in the middle.\n- By operating as a giver, Hornik created value for himself while maximizing opportunities for value to flow outward for the benefit of others.\n- These givers reverse the popular plan of succeeding first and giving back later, raising the possibility that those who give first are often best positioned for success later\n- I‚Äôm going to debunk two common myths about givers by showing you that they‚Äôre not necessarily nice, and they‚Äôre not necessarily altruistic\n- Successful givers recognize that there‚Äôs a big difference between taking and receiving\n- when givers succeed: it spreads and cascades\n- When takers win, there‚Äôs usually someone else who loses\n- As the venture capitalist Randy Komisar remarks, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don‚Äôt make enemies out there, it‚Äôs easier to succeed.‚Äù\n- In the Oval Office, Lincoln was determined to put the good of the nation above his own ego. When he won the presidency in 1860, he invited the three candidates whom he defeated for the Republican nomination to become his secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, and attorney general\n- If politics can be fertile ground for givers, it‚Äôs possible that givers can succeed in any job.\n- Whether giving is effective, though, depends on the particular kind of exchange in which it‚Äôs employed\n- In purely zero-sum situations and win-lose interactions, giving rarely pays off\n- As Chip Conley, the renowned entrepreneur who founded Joie de Vivre Hotels, explains, ‚ÄúBeing a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it‚Äôs valuable in a marathon.‚Äù\n- Conley believes that in today‚Äôs connected world, where relationships and reputations are more visible, givers can accelerate their pace.\n- As we organize more people into teams, givers have more opportunities to demonstrate their value, as Lincoln did.\n- As the service sector continues to expand, more and more people are placing a premium on providers who have established relationships and reputations as givers. Whether your reciprocity style is primarily giver, taker, or matcher, I‚Äôm willing to bet that you want your key service providers to be givers\n- Why did the giver disadvantage reverse, becoming such a strong advantage?\n    - Note: What is to say that the givers were not just more hardworking? For a longr time?\n- The fear of being judged as weak or na√Øve prevents many people from operating like givers at work.\n- There‚Äôs even evidence that just putting on a business suit and analyzing a Harvard Business School case is enough to significantly reduce the attention that people pay to relationships and the interests of others.\n- writes the Cornell economist Robert Frank, that ‚Äúby encouraging us to expect the worst in others it brings out the worst in us: dreading the role of the chump, we are often loath to heed our nobler instincts.‚Äù\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/How-Will-You-Measure-Your-Life":{"title":"","content":"# How Will You Measure Your Life?\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-6.71d9a01814f7.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Christensen, Clayton M.]]\n- Full Title: How Will You Measure Your Life?\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- there is a second school of thought‚Äîoften called two-factor theory, or motivation theory‚Äîor motivation theory‚Äîthat turns the incentive theory on its head\n- This theory distinguishes between two different types of factors: hygiene factors and motivation factors\n- the elements of work that, if not done right, will cause us to be dissatisfied. These are called hygiene factors\n- Hygiene factors are things like status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and\n- supervisory practices\n- compensation is a hygiene factor, not a motivator\n- if you instantly improve the hygiene factors of your job, you‚Äôre not going to suddenly love it. At best, you just won‚Äôt hate it anymore.\n- Motivation factors include challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth.\n- Feelings that you are making a meaningful contribution to work arise from intrinsic conditions of the work itself.\n- Many of my peers had chosen careers using hygiene factors as the primary criteria; income was often the most important of these.\n- Many people view their education as an investment\n- It wasn‚Äôt too long, however, before some of them privately admitted that they had actually begun to resent the jobs they‚Äôd taken‚Äîfor what they now realized were the wrong reasons.\n- They‚Äôd managed to expand their lifestyle to fit the salaries they were bringing in, and it was really difficult to wind that back\n- They‚Äôd made choices early on because of the hygiene factors, not true motivators, and they couldn‚Äôt find their way out of that trap.\n- But after it was finished, I rarely saw the children in it. The truth was that having the house wasn‚Äôt what really motivated them. It was the building of it, and how they felt about their own contribution, that they found satisfying. I had thought the destination was what was important, but it turned out it was the journey.\n- if you want to help other people, be a manager. If done well, management is among the\n- most noble of professions\n- You have the opportunity to frame each person‚Äôs work so that, at the end of every day, your employees will go home feeling like Diana felt on her good day: living a life filled with motivators\n- In order to really find happiness, you need to continue looking for opportunities that you believe are meaningful, in which you will be able to learn new things, to succeed, and be given more and more responsibility to shoulder.\n- it is frightfully easy for us to lose our sense of the difference between what brings money and what causes happiness.\n- The theory of motivation suggests you need to ask yourself a different set of questions than most of us are used to asking. Is this work meaningful to me? Is this job going to give me a chance to develop? Am I going to learn new things? Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement? Am I going to be given responsibility? These are the things that will truly motivate you.\n- The first source is anticipated opportunities‚Äîthe opportunities that you can see and choose to pursue\n- The second source of options is unanticipated‚Äîusually a cocktail of problems and opportunities that emerges while you are trying to implement the deliberate plan or strategy that you have decided upon\n- The unanticipated problems and opportunities then essentially fight the deliberate strategy for the attention, capital, and hearts of the management and employees\n- The decision sometimes is an explicit decision; often, however, a modified strategy coalesces from myriad day-to-day decisions to pursue unanticipated opportunities and resolve unanticipated problems. When\n- strategy forms in this way, it is known as emergent strategy.\n- When the company‚Äôs leaders made a clear decision to pursue the new direction, the emergent strategy became the new deliberate strategy.\n- But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The process of strategy then reiterates through these steps over and over again, constantly evolving. In other words, strategy is not a discrete analytical event‚Äîsomething decided, say, in a meeting of top managers based on the best numbers and analysis available at the time. Rather, it is a continuous, diverse, and unruly process\n- In our lives and in our careers, whether we are aware of it or not, we are constantly navigating a path by deciding between our deliberate strategies and the unanticipated alternatives that emerge\n- which you should choose depends on where you are on the journey\n- you have found an outlet in your career that provides both the requisite hygiene factors and motivators, then a deliberate approach makes sense\n- But if you haven‚Äôt reached the point of finding a career that does this for you, then, like a new company finding its way, you need to be emergent.\n- Strategy almost always emerges from a combination of deliberate and unanticipated opportunities.\n- Is the current deliberate strategy the best course to continue on, or is it time to adopt a different strategy that is emerging\n- if one of them requires a substantial investment on your part just to find out whether it‚Äôs something that you‚Äôre going to enjoy? Ideally, you don‚Äôt want to have to go through medical school to figure out you don‚Äôt want to be a doctor. So what can you do to figure\n- discovery-driven planning,\n- what assumptions need to be proved true in order for the strategy to succeed.\n- expecting to have a clear vision of where your life will take you is just wasting time\n- it may actually close your mind to unexpected opportunities\n- you should be prepared to experiment with different opportunities, ready to pivot, and continue to adjust your strategy until you find what it is that both satisfies the hygiene factors and gives you all the motivators. Only then does a deliberate strategy make sense.\n- you‚Äôve got to be honest with yourself about this whole process\n- Change can often be difficult, and it will probably seem easier to just stick with what you are already doing\n- That thinking can be dangerous. You‚Äôre only kicking the can down the road, and you risk waking up one day, years later, looking into the mirror, asking yourself: ‚ÄúWhat am I doing with my life?‚Äù\n- Real strategy‚Äîin companies and in our lives‚Äîis created through hundreds of everyday decisions about where we spend our resources\n- Here is a way to frame the investments that we make in the strategy that becomes our lives: we have resources‚Äîwhich include personal time, energy, talent, and wealth‚Äîand we are using them to try to grow several ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù in our personal lives. These include having a rewarding relationship with our spouse or significant other; raising great children; succeeding in our careers; contributing to our church or community; and so on. Unfortunately, however, our resources are limited and these businesses are competing for them. It‚Äôs exactly the same problem that a corporation has. How should we devote our resources to each of these pursuits?\n- The danger for high-achieving people is that they‚Äôll unconsciously allocate their resources to activities that yield the most immediate, tangible accomplishments.\n- This is often in their careers, as this domain of their life provides the most concrete evidence that they are moving forward\n- how you allocate your own resources can make your life turn out to be exactly as you hope or very different from what you intend.\n- The problem is, lifestyle demands can quickly lock in place the personal resource allocation process.\n- Intending to build a satisfying personal life alongside their professional life, making choices specifically to provide a better life for their family, they unwittingly overlook their spouse and children.\n- Investing time and energy in these relationships doesn‚Äôt offer them that same immediate sense of achievement that a fast-track career does\n- day-today basis, it doesn‚Äôt seem as if things are deteriorating. Your spouse is still there when you get home every night. And kids find new ways to misbehave all the time. It‚Äôs really not until twenty years down the road that you can put your hands on your hips and say, ‚ÄúWe raised good kids.‚Äù\n- In fact, you‚Äôll often see the same sobering pattern when looking at the personal lives of many ambitious people.\n- But there is much more to life than your career.\n- The person you are at work and the amount of time you spend there will impact the person you are outside of work with your family and close friends.\n- You will be constantly pressured, both at home and at work, to give people and projects your attention.\n- You have to make sure that you allocate your resources in a way that is consistent with your priorities.\n- You have to make sure that your own measures of success are aligned with your most important concern.\n- And you have to make sure that you‚Äôre thinking about all these in the right time frame\n- I‚Äôve had to force myself to stay aligned with what matters most to me by setting hard stops\n- If I didn‚Äôt do this, I know I would be tempted to measure my success that day by having solved a problem rather than getting\n- The hot water that softens a carrot will harden an egg\n- As a parent, you will try many things with your child that simply won‚Äôt work.\n- successful companies don‚Äôt succeed because they have the right strategy at the beginning; but rather, because they have money left over after the original strategy fails, so that they can pivot and try another approach\n- When the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth but impatient for profit.\n- Given that 93 percent of companies that ended up being successful had to change their initial strategy, any capital that demands that the early company become very big, very fast, will almost always drive the business off a cliff instead.\n- That is why capital that seeks growth before profits is bad capital.\n- once a viable strategy has been found, investors need to change what they seek‚Äîthey should become impatient for growth and patient for profit\n- Many of us thrive on the intensity of a demanding job‚Äîone that we believe in and enjoy. We like proving what we can do under pressure\n- Many of us thrive on the intensity of a demanding job‚Äîone that we believe in and enjoy.

Even the most committed friends will attempt to stay the course for only so long before they choose to invest their own time, energy, and friendship somewhere else. If they do, the loss will be yours.\n- The consequences of letting that happen, however, can be enormous.\n- One of the most common versions of this mistake that high-potential young professionals make is believing that investments in life\n- can be sequenced. The logic is, for example, ‚ÄúI can invest in my career during the early years when our children are small and parenting isn‚Äôt as critical. When our children are a bit older and begin to be interested in things that adults are interested in, then I can lift my foot off my career accelerator. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll focus on my family.‚Äù Guess what. By that time the game is already over.\n- over the first thirty months, the child of ‚Äútalkative‚Äù parents heard an estimated 48 million words spoken, compared to the disadvantaged child, who heard only 13 million. The most important time for the children to hear the words, the research suggests, is the first year of life.\n- when parents engaged in face-to-face conversation with the child‚Äîspeaking in fully adult, sophisticated language as if the child could be part of a chatty, grown-up conversation‚Äîthe impact on cognitive development was enormous.\n- These richer interactions they called ‚Äúlanguage dancing.‚Äù Language dancing is being chatty, thinking aloud, and commenting on what the child is doing and what the parent is doing or planning to do.\n- The effect on brain cells is exponential.\n- That means children who have been exposed to extra talk have an almost incalculable cognitive advantage.\n- as you are getting your career off the ground, you will be tempted to do exactly that: assume you can defer investing in your personal relationships. You cannot.\n- If you work to understand what job you are being hired to do, both professionally and in your personal life, the payoff will be enormous.\n- the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to\n- the factors that determine what a company can and cannot do‚Äîits capabilities‚Äîfall into one of three buckets: resources, processes, and priorities\n- no company starts out with its capabilities fully developed\n- The most tangible of the three factors is resources, which include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers\n- The ways in\n- which those employees interact, coordinate, communicate, and make decisions are known as processes.\n- These enable the resources to solve more and more complicated problems.\n- made, and the methods by which market research, budgeting, employee development\n- The third‚Äîand perhaps most significant‚Äîcapability is an organization‚Äôs priorities. This set of factors defines how a company makes decisions\n- it can give clear guidance about what a company is likely to invest in, and what it will not\n- successful senior executives need to spend a lot of time articulating clear, consistent priorities that are broadly understood throughout the organization\n- suppliers in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and China have become capable of making products and components that their American customers, who outsourced to these suppliers in the first place, could no longer hope to ever make.\n- The theory of capabilities gives companies the framework to determine when outsourcing makes sense, and when it does not\n- rather, focus on what they are striving to be able to do in the future.\n- Second, and most critical of all: figure out what capabilities you will need to succeed in the future.\n- It may seem funny to think of ourselves as a composite of resources, processes, and priorities, just like a business. But it‚Äôs an insightful way to assess what we are able to accomplish in our own lives‚Äîand what might be out of our reach. I‚Äôll\n- The idea that one might hire someone else to mow the lawn and shovel the snow at your home‚Äîit just never happened. There was so much work going on that children essentially worked for their parents.\n- Now the only work being done in many of our homes is a periodic cleanup of the mess that we make. In the absence of work, we‚Äôve created a generation of parents who selflessly devote themselves to providing their children with enriching experiences\n- parents, often with their heart in the right place, project their own hopes and dreams onto their children.\n  When these other intentions start creeping in, and parents seem to be carting their children around to an endless array of activities in which the kids are not truly engaged, it should start to raise red flags\n- Many parents are making the same mistake, flooding their children with resources‚Äîknowledge, skills, and experiences\n- But the nature of these activities‚Äîexperiences in which they‚Äôre not deeply engaged and that don‚Äôt really challenge them to do hard things‚Äîdenies our children the opportunity to develop the processes they‚Äôll need to succeed in the future.\n- Self-esteem‚Äîthe sense that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid to confront this problem and I think I can solve it‚Äù‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt\n- come from abundant resources. Rather, self-esteem comes from achieving something important when it‚Äôs hard to do.\n- By sheltering children from the problems that arise in life, we have inadvertently denied this generation the ability to develop the processes and priorities it needs to succeed.\n- children will learn when they are ready to learn, not when we‚Äôre ready to teach them\n- first, when children are ready to learn, we need to be there\n- second, we need to\n- want our children to learn.\n- even if you‚Äôre doing it with the best of intentions, if you find yourself heading\n- and more of the precious opportunities to help your kids develop their values‚Äîwhich may be the most important capability of all.\n- The idea that some people have innate talents that just need to be identified has proved to be an unreliable predictor of success in business.\n- Of all of the people that you hired or promoted into positions of (defined) responsibility\n- what percentage of them turned out to be a superb choice?\n- a third were superb choices; 40 percent were adequate choices; and about 25 percent turned out to be mistakes.\n- Morgan McCall, a professor at the University of Southern California, in a book called High Flyers\n- McCall has a very different view of the ‚Äúright stuff.‚Äù\n- Instead, it was because they had honed them along the way, by having experiences that taught them how to deal with setbacks or extreme stress in high-stakes situations.\n- Unlike the ‚Äúright stuff‚Äù model, McCall‚Äôs thinking is not based on the idea that great leaders are born ready to go. Rather, their abilities are developed and shaped by experiences in life.\n- Had we looked for the past-tense verbs on their r√©sum√©s, however, Candidate B would have won hands-down‚Äîbecause the r√©sum√© would have shown that he had taken the right courses in the schools of experience\n- that was in a steady state. He had never started and built anything before‚Äîand as a consequence, he knew nothing of the problems that one encounters when starting up a new factory and scaling production of a new process\n- What are all the experiences and problems that I have to learn about and master so that what comes out at the other end is somebody who is ready and capable of becoming a successful CEO?‚Äù\n- Archibald had a clear goal in mind when he graduated from college\n- Nolan Archibald\n- the youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company‚ÄîBlack \u0026 Decker.\n- it would be risky to draft someone with no experience to do the job‚Äîbecause in the absence of processes that can guide people, experienced people need to lead\n- you can find small opportunities for your child to take important courses early on\n- the right lesson: that when you aim to achieve great things, it is inevitable that sometimes you‚Äôre not going to make it\n- you should also celebrate failure if it‚Äôs as a result of a child striving for an out-of-reach goal.\n- I always wanted the kids to take responsibility for organizing their own camping trips rather than letting the parents step in to do it\n- It sure would have been easier to allow the parents to work\n- But we would have been denying them important courses‚Äîleadership, organization, and accountability\n- child announces that he has a big report or project due the next day and he hasn‚Äôt started it\n- What should a parent do?\n- many parents stay up late to help their child complete the project, some parents might even finish it for him\n- you‚Äôve taken him through the experience of learning how to take shortcuts.\n- Allow the child to see the consequences of neglecting an important assignment\n- Either he will have to stay up late on his own to pull it off, or he will see what happens when he fails to complete it\n- if our children don‚Äôt face difficult challenges, and sometimes fail along the way, they will not build the resilience they will need throughout their lives.\n- You should consciously think about what abilities you want your child to develop, and then what experiences will likely help him get them.\n- Creating experiences for your children doesn‚Äôt guarantee that they‚Äôll learn what they need to learn\n- If that doesn‚Äôt happen, you have to figure out why that experience didn‚Äôt achieve it\n- right\n- The important thing for a parent is, as always, to never give up; never stop trying to help your children get the right experiences to prepare them for life.\n- Coping with a difficult teacher, failing at a sport, learning to navigate the complex social structure of cliques in school‚Äîall those things become ‚Äúcourses‚Äù in the school of experience.\n- The natural tendency of many parents is to focus entirely on building your child‚Äôs r√©sum√©: good grades, sports successes, and so on. It would be a mistake, however, to neglect the courses your children need to equip them for the future. Once you have that figured out, work backward: find the right experiences to help them build the skills they‚Äôll need to succeed. It‚Äôs one of the greatest gifts you can give them.\n- One of the most powerful tools to enable us to close the gap between the family we want and the family we get is culture. We\n- Their priorities need to be set correctly\n- Culture is a way of working together toward common goals that have been followed so frequently and so successfully that people don‚Äôt even think about trying to do things another\n- way. If a culture has formed, people will autonomously do what they need to do to be successful.\n- they are the result of shared learning‚Äîof employees working together to solve problems and figuring out what works.\n- In the language of capabilities from the previous chapters, they are creating an understanding of the priorities in the business, and how to execute them‚Äîthe processes. A culture is the unique combination of processes and priorities within an organization.\n- If these paradigms of how to work together, and of what things should be given priority\n- over other things, are used successfully over and over again, ultimately employees won‚Äôt stop and ask each other how they should work together. They will just assume that the way they have been doing it is the way of doing it. The advantage of this is that it effectively causes an organization to become self-managing\n- Culture in any organization is formed through repetition\n- The more often they solve the problem successfully, the more instinctive it becomes to do it in the way that they designed.\n- The parallels between a business and a family should be clear. Just like a manager who wants to count on employees using the right priorities to solve problems, parents want to set those priorities, too, so that family members will solve problems and confront dilemmas instinctively, whether or not the parents are there guiding or observing.\n- If you want your family to have a culture with a clear set of priorities for everyone to follow, then those priorities need to be proactively designed into the culture\n- Make no mistake: a culture happens, whether you want it to or not. The only question is how hard you are going to try to influence it. Forming a culture is not an instant loop; it‚Äôs not something you can decide on, communicate, and then expect it to suddenly work on its own\n- Children might feel ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in the short term by getting what they want in beating up a sibling, or talking back to a parent who finally relents to an unreasonable demand. Parents who let such behavior slide are essentially building a family culture‚Äîteaching\n- that\n- The safest road to Hell is the gradual one‚Äîthe gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.\n- in evaluating alternative investments, we should ignore sunk and fixed costs (costs that have already been incurred), and instead base decisions on the marginal costs and marginal revenues (the new costs and revenues) that each alternative entails.\n- Every time an executive in an established company needs to make an investment decision, there are two alternatives on the menu. The first is the full cost of making something completely new. The second is to leverage what already exists, so that you only need to incur the marginal cost and revenue.\n- For the entrant, in contrast, there is no marginal-cost item on the menu. If it makes sense, then you do the full-cost alternative.\n- As Henry Ford once put it, ‚ÄúIf you need a machine and don‚Äôt buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and\n- don‚Äôt have it.‚Äù\n- to maximize the value of the advice in this book, you must have a purpose in your life\n- A useful statement of purpose for a company needs three parts. The first is what I will call a likeness.\n- oils. A likeness of a company is what the key leaders and employees want the enterprise to have become at the end of the path that they are on\n- Second, for a purpose to be useful, employees and executives need to have a deep commitment‚Äîalmost a conversion‚Äîto the likeness that they are trying to create.\n- employees without this deep conversion will find that the world will compromise the likeness by wave after wave of extenuating circumstances.\n- The third part of a company‚Äôs purpose is one or a few metrics by which managers and employees can measure their progress. These metrics enable everyone associated with the enterprise to calibrate their work, keeping them moving together in a coherent way.\n- These three parts‚Äîlikeness, commitment, and metrics‚Äîcomprise a company‚Äôs purpose\n- Purpose must be deliberately conceived and chosen, and then pursued\n- When that is in place, however, then how the company gets there is typically emergent‚Äîas opportunities and challenges emerge and are pursued.\n- The type of person you want to become‚Äîwhat the purpose of your life is‚Äîis too important to leave to chance. It needs to be deliberately conceived, chosen, and managed. The opportunities and challenges in your life that allow you to become that person will, by their very nature, be emergent.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes":{"title":"","content":"# How to Take Smart Notes\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication123/v4/c6/48/c8/c648c8c5-3078-d555-1f7c-6f1e282ab8af/0000575585.jpg/1400x2234w.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[S√∂nke Ahrens]]\n- Full Title: How to Take Smart Notes\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.\n- the process of writing starts much, much\n  earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument\n  is the smallest part of its development.\n- This book aims to fill this gap by\n  showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into\n  convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected\n  notes along the way.\n- those who take smart\n  notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again\n- The\n  right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even\n  years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best\n  possible position to write a great paper easily?\n- They struggle because they believe, as they are made to\n  believe, that writing starts with a blank page.\n- good, productive writing is based on good note-taking\n- The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends\n  more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a\n  decision on the topic.\n- What does make a\n  significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else:\n  how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand\n- there is no measurable correlation between a high\n  IQ and academic success ‚Äì at least not north of 120.\n- self-control and\n  self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with\n  ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) ‚Äì and the environment can be changed.\n- Not having willpower, but not\n  having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.\n- A\n  good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of\n  remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you\n  can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and\n  you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the\n  ideas.\n- A good structure enables flow,\n- If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself;\n  it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push\n  yourself and employ willpower.\n- The challenge is to structure one‚Äôs\n  workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that\n  push us forward.\n- How do you plan for insight, which, by definition,\n  cannot be anticipated?\n- a\n  system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information,\n  which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim\n  of generating new ideas.\n- Dunning-Kruger effect\n- high achievers\n  who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to\n  suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome\n- overly\n  confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their\n  abilities.\n- There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have.\n  Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway.\n- The first idea lies at the heart of\n  this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box.\n- Even the best tool will not improve your\n  productivity considerably if you don‚Äôt change your daily routines the tool is embedded\n  in, just as the fastest car won‚Äôt help you much if you don‚Äôt have proper roads\n  to drive it on.\n- as soon as you get used to taking\n  smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that you will wonder how you\n  were ever able to get anything done before.\n- The\n  importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen‚Äôs\n  ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù (Allen, 2001)\n- And this\n  is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if\n  you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go\n  and let you focus on the task at hand.\n- What\n  we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a\n  successful organization lies in the holistic perspective\n- Niklas Luhmann\n- he turned note-taking on its head.\n  Instead of adding notes to existing categories or the respective texts, he\n  wrote them all on small pieces of paper, put a number in the corner and\n  collected them in one place: the slip-box.\n- He realised that one idea, one\n  note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context\n  it was taken from.\n- I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how\n  to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something\n  else.‚Äù\n- We are still so used to\n  the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not to believe\n  that a simple change in our work routines could not only make us more\n  productive, but the work also more fun.\n- success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability\n  to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments\n  that avoid resistance in the first place\n- This is\n  not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right\n  workflow\n- if you don‚Äôt have an external system to think in and organise\n  your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in\n  your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just\n  can‚Äôt be compensated by a high IQ. \n  As\n- Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained\n  the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main\n  one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what\n  he read.\n- Whenever\n  he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of\n  a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013,\n  170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box\n- In\n  a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about\n  their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the\n  main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of\n  paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the\n  paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of\n  the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single\n  sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.\n- He\n  usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the\n  slip-box.\n- And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with\n  great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full\n  sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his\n  material.\n- He then would add\n  references\n- to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were\n  located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were\n  directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious\n  connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.\n- He\n  did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a\n  transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation\n  where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the\n  original meaning as truthfully as possible.\n- The\n  trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather\n  abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were\n  only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or\n  directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or\n  addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.\n- Whenever\n  he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make\n  possible connections between them\n- The\n  last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one\n  or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought\n  or topic.\n- We need a reliable and\n  simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of\n  our brains\n- Make fleeting notes.\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- These\n  are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head.

In the\n  new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it\n  again?\n- The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system\n  organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the\n  more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing.\n- It can only play out its strengths when\n  we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of\n  notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled\n- Fleeting\n  notes\n- Permanent notes\n- Project notes\n- Nothing motivates us more than the experience\n  of becoming better at what we do\n- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better\n  (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being\n  praised (which is outwardly rewarding).\n- Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks\n  tend to occupy our short-term memory\n- The brain doesn't distinguish\n  between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note.

They are crucial for learning\n- As literature notes are also a\n  tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense\n  in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just\n  jot down some keywords\n- Whenever we explore a new,\n  unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn‚Äôt\n  get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we\n  cannot skip. Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a\n  difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single\n  sentence\n- You need to take\n  some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so\n  you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box\n  note. But don‚Äôt turn it into a project in itself\n- indiscriminate gathering of any relevant\n  information regardless of what argument it will support\n- The\n  slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant\n  notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting\n  thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw\n  conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.\n- while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing\n  it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as\n  ineffectual.\n- In\n  short: Pure re-viewing just doesn‚Äôt make any sense, neither for understanding\n  nor for learning\n- the best-researched and most successful\n  learning method is elaboration\n- The objection that it takes\n  too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore\n  short-sighted\n- Not learning from what\n  we read because we don‚Äôt take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of\n  time.\n- see\n  what is not mentioned in the text\n- real thinking\n  requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing\n- A\n  common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out\n  the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought\n- Notes are only as valuable as\n  the note and reference networks they are embedded in\n- To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable\n  collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need.\n- Tools\n  are only as good as your ability to work with them.\n- it is\n  indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with\n  it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own\n  needs\n- An idea kept\n  private is as good as one you never had.\n- underlining sentences or writing comments in the\n  margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.\n  They will very soon become completely useless ‚Äì unless you do something with\n  them. If you already know that you will not go back to them, don‚Äôt take these\n  kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Know-Me-Keep-Me":{"title":"","content":"# Know Me, Keep Me\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xkLl-nE+L._SY160.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Barbara Gee]]\n- Full Title: Know Me, Keep Me\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- breathed, holding her hand up and admiring ([Location¬†7251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B018FTHJPQ\u0026location=7251))\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Million-Dollar-Consulting":{"title":"","content":"# Million Dollar Consulting\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-3.40504e56b01b.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Alan Weiss]]\n- Full Title: Million Dollar Consulting\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- When we consider consultants in this book, we‚Äôre talking about expertise. Consultants are experts, not mere advice givers.\n- Consultant: An expert in one or more identified areas who partners with a client to improve the client‚Äôs condition.\n- Once you walk away from a successful engagement, the client‚Äôs ‚Äústate‚Äù should be better than it was when you got there\n- If you work on an important issue with zero transfer of skills, you‚Äôre simply an independent expert (upper left). You ski, but you can‚Äôt teach me to ski\n- If you transfer significant skills but not for an important issue (lower right) then you‚Äôre an interventionist\n- You‚Äôve done these things yourself and can teach them. But you teach them generically, not because there is an urgent issue at the moment.\n- The upper right, collaborator, represents the real value in consulting, where you are both transferring skills and doing so as a vital issue is resolved. That‚Äôs where the highest value and concomitant highest fees reside.\n- Expertise: Great consultants teach others how to do what they do and do not create codependencies. Counterintuitively, the more intellectual property you transfer, the more the client will value you.\n- if you charge by the hour you‚Äôre an amateur\n- When expertise becomes so obvious and apparent that the consultant is sought out by clients, a powerful brand has been created, based on the allure of one‚Äôs expertise. When that happens, credibility, terms, fees, and other factors are no longer any kind of obstacle or barrier.\n- the secret to Million Dollar Consulting as a metaphor is that you have to continually work smarter, not harder\n- The progression often looks like this (read from bottom to top):\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Retainer\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Project oversight\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Project implementation\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Work at client request\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Subcontractor\n- 1.¬†¬†¬†Streamline Your Business\n    - Note: Do only as much work as is necessary. Streamline your labor. Strive to minimize it. Work smart, not hard.\n- 2.¬†¬†¬†Delegate Work to the Client\n    - Note: Most clients will have better las resources and technicians to get lab measurements and things like that done, doing it myself will be a major pain!\n- 3.¬†¬†¬†Subcontract\n    - Note: Get other people to do some of the grunt work, Or if you know someone better of it, just let them do it.\n- You require three things to be successful in this business:\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Passion. You must love what you do.\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Competency. You must be good at what you do.\n  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Need. You must identify or create client need.\n    - Note: For modeling work, I have reasonable passion and high level of competency. Is there a need though?\n- the great careers in consulting are built around what you love to do and are great at doing. It is not a process of continual addition, but actually one of culling.\n- Carve away everything that you aren‚Äôt great at and don‚Äôt love, and you‚Äôll create the artwork of your career.\n- To begin, state your value proposition. This is a brief statement of how the buyer is improved after you leave, hence, it is always a business outcome or result, never an input or deliverable\n    - Note: My value proposition: greatly improve chances of first pass design success!\n- Your ideal buyer is that economic buyer who can spend money for your value proposition\n    - Note: Rf design teams in small to mid size companies without design support. Ideally, it will be the technical engineering lead, or vp of the engineering department.\n- Buying lists for a few pennies per name from people overseas may seem like a bargain, but it is not, for two reasons: The first reason is that cold-calling doesn‚Äôt work. But the second is that such lists are never useful in terms of your ideal buyers.\n- Let‚Äôs be clear: We do not grow and prosper by correcting weaknesses; we grow and prosper by building on strengths\n- determine your ‚Äúsweet spot,‚Äù which is what you are great at doing consistently\n- The ‚Äúspokes‚Äù around the sweet spot are factors or components of it\n- What intellectual property (IP) will support those components?\n- Expertise: IP doesn‚Äôt exist, and isn‚Äôt created, in a vacuum. It should be created within your competency and passion to support your name and brand.\n- The recognition of your value proposition (your passion around your contribution), your ideal buyer (the person who will invest in your passion because there is perceived need that exists or you create), and your sweet spot (the thing you‚Äôre great at doing and want to do and that gives you great satisfaction), is the heart of your success in growing a solo practice and/or a boutique firm\n- Marketing is the art and science of creating need. You can reach out to people to do this, but it‚Äôs far more effective to attract them to you\n- the effective strategy is ‚ÄúBuild it and tell them you‚Äôve built it, and they will come.‚Äù\n    - Note: I need to create a consistent stream of content via blogs and videos and post that linked in telling people what built i'v\n- When buyers approach you because they‚Äôve heard of you and are interested in your value (gravity), they seldom look into credibility or inquire about fees\n- market gravity\n- Commercial publishing\n    - Note: I could write for microwave journal, ee Times microwave magazine and publish articles there.\n- Speaking\n- Web presence\n- Word of mouth\n- Teaching\n- Networking\n- Referrals\n- all of these (and other) gravity factors, referrals, networking, and speaking have the best potential for short-term business and fairly rapid cash.\n- Expertise: The accelerant curve does not arise by default. It must be consciously planned and examined for adjustment as you become more successful.\n- Brand creation begins with the three components we discussed earlier: passion, competency, and market need\n- Brand creation\n- Brand building\n- Brand equity\n- Expertise: It‚Äôs never too early or too late to create, refine, and/or abandon brands. Monitor their effectiveness constantly.\n- A brand enables market gravity to more readily attract people to you, and when people knock on your door, credibility is assumed and fees are whatever you say they are.\n- you are building a solo practice, which will generate cash for you every year but which obviously won‚Äôt be sold since it consists only of you, work toward your name as the brand\n- your value proposition\n- you identify what you are great at\n- Carve away everything else\n- Find your ideal buyers\n- Use market gravity\n- Place them on your Accelerant Curve\n- Expertise: The steps are easy, but we keep getting distracted by squirrels\n- many consultants have a bad case of the ‚Äúimposter syndrome\n- The smaller the project, the more demanding the client\n- We think the project is easy. It rarely is\n- magic bullet\n- You have to be happy and well to treat others well, because this is the ultimate relationship business\n- An economic buyer is a person who has the ability to write a check (have a check issued) for your value without the approval of anyone else\n- How do we create the same levels of trusting relationship that exist with longtime clients in brand-new prospects\n- Create evangelists\n- Provide opportunity\n- Use testimonials, references, and case studies shamelessly\n- here‚Äôs how to accelerate the positive, trusting relationship that existing buyers already have with you:\n- Create a peer-to-peer dynamic\n- Always keep in mind that you are there to offer value\n- Gauge the other person‚Äôs sense of speed\n- Guide the conversation\n- Show confidence\n- Push back when appropriate\n- what‚Äôs required is someone suggesting that the buyer‚Äôs alternative is not the best, his or her evaluation not valid, his or her suppositions not based on empirical evidence\n- It‚Äôs important to regard your existing buyer, in most cases, as a prospect as well.\n- that you can be of help in additional areas and dimensions\n- two buyers a week on average\n- if you see your existing buyers also as prospective buyers, and if you include them to the maximum degree in your two-buyers-a-week drill, you will significantly improve the percentage of new business that results. It‚Äôs all in the numbers.\n- two sales are made when you successfully conclude an agreement\n- The first occurs when the proposal is signed and you receive your check to begin. The second occurs when you derive referral and repeat business from that buyer.\n  Too often, consultants ignore or forget the second sale, thereby denying themselves half of the business potential\n- You should have been meeting the buyer‚Äôs peers, subordinates, and relevant others during your tenure\n- Follow your buyers to new positions within the same organization or in new ones\n- Assiduously create referral business\n- Elicit contemporary testimonials, case studies, and war stories as your tenure progresses\n- offer to ‚Äúdebrief‚Äù and bring the new person up to speed on the project and its trajectory\n- Never cease marketing to new prospects\n- In any one year, a ratio of about 80 percent repeat business and 20 percent new business is quite good.\n- Pro bono work\n    - Note: Can I use a model of doing a 2 week period for free and then letting them continue if like what I do? I will only need to do this for a short while till business referrals pick up.\n- Create and nurture your ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù group\n- Proposals are most effective when they satisfy personal objectives of the buyer in additional to business issues\n- However, true, sustaining trust is built on an emotional connection. Think of it as the honest belief that the other person has your best interests in mind\n- You can‚Äôt be a supplicant or appear obsequious. You should appear as a peer of the buyer. That means your examples should be relevant to his or her level and situation, and your frames of reference should be appropriate for the industry. For\n- Don‚Äôt allow the conversation to drift out of your channel.\n- To control the conversation, you also need to interrupt the buyer. That‚Äôs right, interrupt\n- Otherwise, with the best of intentions, polite discourse could take you to territories uncharted and far removed from your intended destination.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Never-Finished":{"title":"","content":"# Never Finished\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-5.25188386e520.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[David Goggins]]\n- Full Title: Never Finished\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- When you‚Äôre hogtied in conflicting emotions and other people‚Äôs opinions, it‚Äôs impossible to tap into belief and easy to drift away from that urge to evolve. You could be itchy as fuck to experience something different, to be somewhere different, or to become someone different, but when the slightest resistance arises to challenge your resolve, you moonwalk right back into the unsatisfied person you were before. Still itchy, still jonesing to be someone new, yet still trapped in your unfulfilling status quo. And you are nowhere near alone.\n- Then there‚Äôs the belief born in resilience. It comes from working your way through layers of pain, fatigue, and reason, and ignoring the ever-present temptation to quit until you strike a source of fuel you didn‚Äôt even know existed.\n- I‚Äôm haunted by my future goals, not my past failures. I‚Äôm haunted by what I may still become. I‚Äôm haunted by my own continued thirst for evolution.\n- there is a drop-dead time on everything we do in life. All our dreams and visions come with expiration dates etched in invisible ink\n- Windows of opportunity can and do close, so it is imperative that we do not waste time on bullshit. None of us have any clue what‚Äôs coming for us or when our time might run out, which is why I do my best to ignore anything that is counterproductive.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Outlive":{"title":"","content":"# Outlive\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-100/0111-1/{072CF516-5ABF-42C8-8D3E-47136E395AF8}IMG100.JPG)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Peter Attia, MD]]\n- Full Title: Outlive\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- exercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life\n- even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years\n- It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan\n- if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exercise\n- if exercise is not a part of your life at the moment, you are not alone‚Äî77 percent of the US population is like you\n- Going from zero weekly exercise to just ninety minutes per week can reduce your risk of dying from all causes by 14¬†percent\n- regular exercisers live as much as a decade longer than sedentary people\n- The data on exercise tell us, with great clarity, that the more we do, the better off we will be\n- cardiorespiratory or aerobic fitness. This means how efficiently your body can deliver oxygen to your muscles, and how efficiently your muscles can extract that oxygen, enabling you to run (or walk) or cycle or swim long distances.\n- peak aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness, measured in terms of VO2 max, is perhaps the single most powerful marker for longevity\n- VO2 max represents the maximum rate at which a person can utilize oxygen\n    - Tags: [[green]] \n- VO2 max is typically expressed in terms of the volume of oxygen a person can use, per kilogram of body weight, per minute. An average forty-five-year-old man will have a VO2 max around 40 ml/kg/min, while an elite endurance athlete will likely score in the high 60s and above\n- The higher someone‚Äôs VO2 max, the more oxygen they can consume to make ATP, and the faster they can ride or run‚Äîin short, the more they can do.\n- poor cardiorespiratory fitness carries a greater relative risk of death than smoking\n- having a higher VO2 max is better for your overall health and longevity than having a lower VO2 max.\n- The fitter you are, the lower your risk of death. Again, there is no other intervention, drug or otherwise, that can rival this magnitude of benefit. Exercise is so effective against diseases of aging‚Äîthe Horsemen‚Äîthat it has often been compared to medicine.\n- When we are exercising, our muscles generate molecules known as cytokines that send signals to other parts of our bodies, helping to strengthen our immune system and stimulate the growth of new muscle and stronger bones.\n- Endurance exercise such as running or cycling helps generate another potent molecule called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, that improves the health and function of the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays an essential role in memory.\n- exercise is even more effective at preserving healthspan than extending lifespan.\n- One of the prime hallmarks of aging is that our physical capacity erodes.\n- fat-free mass (meaning mostly muscle mass) and activity levels remain relatively consistent as people age from their twenties and thirties into middle age. But both physical activity levels and muscle mass decline steeply after about age sixty-five, and then even more steeply after about seventy-five. It‚Äôs as if people just fall off a cliff sometime in their mid-seventies.\n- By age eighty, the average person will have lost eight kilograms of muscle, or about eighteen pounds, from their peak\n- Continued muscle loss and inactivity literally puts our lives at risk\n- Your exoskeleton (muscle) is what keeps your actual skeleton (bones) upright and intact.\n- falls are by far the leading cause of accidental deaths in those ages sixty-five and older‚Äîand this is without even counting the people who die three or six or twelve months after their nonfatal but still serious fall pushed them into a long and painful decline.\n- Just as with VO2 max, it is important to maintain muscle mass at all costs.\n- the more effort you‚Äôre willing to put in now, the more benefit you‚Äôll reap in the future.\n- This is why I place such an emphasis on weight training‚Äîand doing it now, no matter your age\n- I will find a way to lift heavy weights in some way, shape, or form four times per week, no matter what else I am doing or where I might be traveling.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Sapiens":{"title":"","content":"# Sapiens\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://up.bookfusion.com/book/cover/002/271/682/2729163d36fdf689.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Yuval Noah Harari]]\n- Full Title: Sapiens\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Humans in Europe and western Asia evolved into Homo neanderthalensis (‚ÄòMan from the Neander Valley), popularly referred to simply as ‚ÄòNeanderthals\n- On another Indonesian island ‚Äì the small island of Flores ‚Äì archaic humans underwent a process of dwarfing. Humans first reached Flores when the sea level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island, which was poor in resources. Big people, who need a lot of food, died\n- first. Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people of Flores became dwarves. This unique species, known by scientists as Homo floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only one metre and weighed no more than twenty-five kilograms.\n- The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man\n- The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It‚Äôs not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It‚Äôs even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2‚Äì3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body‚Äôs energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied.\n- Adjusting to an upright position was quite a challenge, especially when the scaffolding had to support an extra-large cranium. Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and stiff necks\n- Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births\n- Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom\n- Genus Homo‚Äôs position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle\n- only in the last 100,000 years ‚Äì with the rise of Homo sapiens ‚Äì that man jumped to the top of the food chain.\n- Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous\n- It turned out that 1‚Äì4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it‚Äôs significant. A second shock came several months later, when DNA extracted from the fossilised finger from Denisova was mapped. The results proved that up to 6 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians is Denisovan DNA.\n- Since Neanderthals and Denisovans contributed only a small amount of DNA to our present-day genome, it is impossible to speak of a ‚Äòmerger‚Äô between Sapiens and other human species.\n- So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express\n- It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.\n- Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to imagine that we are the epitome of creation, and that a chasm separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom\n- What was the Sapiens‚Äô secret of success? How did we manage to settle so rapidly in so many distant and ecologically different habitats? How did we push all other human species into oblivion? Why couldn‚Äôt\n- even the strong, brainy, cold-proof Neanderthals survive our onslaught? The debate continues to rage. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.\n- accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.\n- We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning\n- What was so special about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?*\n- Our language evolved as a way of gossiping\n- It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It‚Äôs much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat\n- The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it\n- As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled\n- myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers\n- Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‚Äònatural‚Äô size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals\n- Any large-scale human cooperation ‚Äì whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe ‚Äì is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination\n- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations\n- ever since the Cognitive Revolution Homo sapiens has been able to revise its behaviour rapidly in accordance with changing needs. This opened a fast lane of cultural evolution, bypassing the traffic jams of genetic evolution. Speeding down this fast lane, Homo sapiens soon far outstripped all other human and animal species in its ability to cooperate.\n- Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in the appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus\n- As long as Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone tools remained roughly the same ‚Äì for close to 2 million years!\n- The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we call ‚Äòcultures‚Äô.\n- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation.\n- The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era\n- The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes. Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah.\n- But we are largely at a loss in trying to comprehend the beliefs and rituals of ancient hunter-gatherer\n- The Sapiens population was thinly spread over vast territories. Before the Agricultural Revolution, the human population of the entire planet was smaller than that of today‚Äôs Cairo\n- The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history.\n  There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.5 Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‚Äòniches for imbeciles‚Äô were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker.\n- on the whole foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds, labourers and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.\n- In most places and at most times, foraging provided ideal nutrition. That is hardly surprising ‚Äì this had been the human diet for hundreds of thousands of years, and the human body was well adapted to it.\n- Evidence from fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were less likely to suffer from starvation or malnutrition, and were generally taller and healthier than their peasant descendants. Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it through the perilous first years had a good chance of reaching the age of sixty, and some even made it to their eighties.\n- The foragers‚Äô secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet.\n- This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.\n- Ancient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution. Ancient foragers, who had domesticated only dogs, were free of these scourges. Moreover, most people in agricultural and industrial societies lived in dense, unhygienic permanent settlements ‚Äì ideal hotbeds for disease. Foragers roamed the land in small bands that could not sustain epidemics.\n- The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and the rarity of infectious diseases have led many experts to define pre-agricultural forager societies as ‚Äòthe original affluent societies‚Äô.\n- Animism (from ‚Äòanima‚Äô, ‚Äòsoul‚Äô or ‚Äòspirit‚Äô in Latin) is the belief that almost every place, every animal, every plant and every natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with humans.\n- In the animist world, objects and living things are not the only animated beings. There are also immaterial entities ‚Äì the spirits of the dead, and friendly and malevolent beings, the kind that we today call demons, fairies and angels.\n- Theism (from ‚Äòtheos‚Äô, ‚Äògod‚Äô in Greek) is the view that the universal order is based on a hierarchical relationship between humans and a small group of ethereal entities called gods.\n- Instead of erecting mountains of theory over a molehill of tomb relics, cave paintings and bone statuettes, it is better to be frank and admit that we have only the haziest notions about the religions of ancient foragers.\n- Most importantly, we don‚Äôt know what stories they told. It‚Äôs one of the biggest holes in our understanding of human history.\n- Just as foragers exhibited a wide array of religions and social structures, so, too, did they probably demonstrate a variety of violence rates. While some areas and some periods of time may have enjoyed peace and tranquillity, others were riven by ferocious conflicts.10\n- Planet Earth was separated into several distinct ecosystems, each made up of a unique assembly of animals and plants. Homo sapiens was about to put an end to this biological exuberance\n- The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history, at least as important as Columbus‚Äô journey to America or the Apollo 11 expedition to the moon\n- The moment the first hunter-gatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the moment that Homo sapiens climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a particular landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals of planet Earth\n- As they pushed on, they encountered a strange universe of unknown creatures that included a 200-kilogram, two-metre kangaroo, and a marsupial lion, as massive as a modern tiger, that was the continent‚Äôs largest predator. Koalas far too big to be cuddly and cute rustled in the trees and flightless birds twice the size of ostriches sprinted on the plains. Dragon-like lizards and snakes five metres long slithered through the undergrowth. The giant diprotodon, a two-and-a-half-ton wombat, roamed the\n- forests. Except for the birds and reptiles, all these animals were marsupials ‚Äì like kangaroos, they gave birth to tiny, helpless, fetus-like young which they then nurtured with milk in abdominal pouches. Marsupial mammals were almost unknown in Africa and Asia, but in Australia they reigned supreme.\n    - Note: The Australian mega fauna was pretty amazing and completely eliminated by the arrival of homo sapiens.\n- Within a few thousand years, virtually all of these giants vanished.\n- Was it all the fault of Homo sapiens?\n- During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years\n- ago. The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages\n- Why, then, did it disappear 45,000 years ago?\n- Human involvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated the terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby oceans\n- the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer\n- All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster?\n- Large animals ‚Äì the primary victims of the Australian extinction ‚Äì breed slowly\n- The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia, they had already mastered fire agriculture\n- A third explanation agrees that hunting and fire agriculture played a significant role in the extinction, but emphasises that we can‚Äôt completely ignore the role of climate. The climate changes that beset Australia about 45,000 years ago destabilised the ecosystem and made it particularly vulnerable\n- Homo sapiens was the first and only human species to reach the western hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around 14,000 BC. The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time, sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia with north-western Alaska\n- The human blitzkrieg across America testifies to the incomparable ingenuity and the unsurpassed adaptability of Homo sapiens\n- Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these unique species were gone\n- Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet‚Äôs big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.\n- The elephant birds and the giant lemurs, along with most of the other large animals of Madagascar, suddenly vanished about 1,500 years ago ‚Äì precisely when the first humans set foot on the island.\n- The Galapagos Islands, to give one famous example, remained uninhabited by humans until the nineteenth century, thus preserving their unique menagerie, including their giant tortoises, which, like the ancient diprotodons, show no fear of humans.\n- The First Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the foragers, was followed by the Second Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the farmers, and gives us an important perspective on the Third Wave Extinction, which industrial activity is causing today. Don‚Äôt believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology\n- Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, the large sea animals suffered relatively little from the Cognitive and Agricultural Revolutions. But many of them are on the brink of extinction now as a result of industrial pollution and human overuse of oceanic resources. If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion. Among all the world‚Äôs large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves in Noah‚Äôs Ark.\n- All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost\n- all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species\n- It was a revolution in the way humans lived ‚Äì the Agricultural Revolution.\n- Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC ‚Äì wheat, rice, maize (called ‚Äòcorn‚Äô in the US), potatoes, millet and barley\n- Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but entirely independently.\n- Why did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South Africa\n- Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitable candidates for farming and herding. Those few species lived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural revolutions occurred\n- Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers\n- The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history‚Äôs biggest fraud.2\n- The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa\n- According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the earth.\n- How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?\n- Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage.\n- Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants.\n- The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks\n- Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments\n- This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.\n- Wheat did not give people economic security.\n- Nor could wheat offer security against human violence\n- we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement\n- Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially.\n- The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes\n- This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.\n- With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow. Giving up the nomadic lifestyle enabled women to have a child every year\n- Babies were weaned at an earlier age\n- people began living in disease-ridden settlements\n- child mortality soared\n- humans kept having larger numbers of children.\n- the ‚Äòwheat bargain‚Äô became more and more burdensome\n- Why did people make such a fateful miscalculation?\n- It made sense. If you worked harder, you would have a better life. That was the plan.\n- Then why didn‚Äôt humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently.\n- And partly because population growth burned humanity‚Äôs boats\n- There was no going back\n- One of history‚Äôs few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.\n- The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson. Humanity‚Äôs search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted.\n- Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it‚Äôs hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution\n- This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is\n- perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution\n- Unfortunately, the evolutionary perspective is an incomplete measure of success. It judges everything by the criteria of survival and reproduction, with no regard for individual suffering and happiness\n- From a narrow evolutionary perspective, which measures success by the number of DNA copies, the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful boon for chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep.\n- THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION IS ONE of the most controversial events in history.\n- This was the turning point, they say, where Sapiens cast off its intimate symbiosis with nature and sprinted towards greed and alienation.\n- Settling down caused most peoples turf to shrink dramatically\n- attachment to ‚Äòmy house‚Äô and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centred creature.\n- The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practices that only became crueller with the passing of the centuries.\n- The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences. It was the foundation of large-scale political and social systems. Sadly, the diligent peasants almost never achieved the future economic security they so craved through their hard work in the present. Everywhere, rulers and elites sprang up, living off the peasants‚Äô surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence.\n- These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than 90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites ‚Äì kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers ‚Äì who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.\n- The Agricultural Revolution made the future far more important than it had ever been before.\n- Farmers must always keep the future in mind and must work in its service.\n- The mere fact that one can feed a thousand people in the same town or a million people in the same kingdom does not guarantee that they can agree how to divide the land and water, how to settle disputes and conflicts, and how to act in times of drought or war.\n- It\n- was not food shortages that caused most of history‚Äôs wars and revolutions\n- The problem at the root of such calamities is that humans evolved for millions of years in small bands of a few dozen individuals\n- The handful of millennia separating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to evolve\n- While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail‚Äôs pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.\n- In 3100 BC the entire lower Nile Valley was united into the first Egyptian kingdom\n- Around 2250 BC Sargon the Great forged the first empire\n- Between 1000 BC and 500 BC, the first mega-empires appeared in the Middle East\n- In 221 BC the Qin dynasty united China,\n- afterwards Rome united the Mediterranean basin\n- Cooperation‚Äô sounds very altruistic, but is not always voluntary and seldom egalitarian. Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and exploitation\n- All these cooperation networks ‚Äì from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to the Qin and Roman empires ‚Äì were ‚Äòimagined orders‚Äô\n- the Code of Hammurabi. This was a collection of laws and judicial decisions whose aim was to present Hammurabi as a role model of a just king, serve as a basis for a more uniform legal system across the Babylonian Empire, and teach future generations what justice is and how a just king acts.\n- Hammurabi‚Äôs Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal and eternal principles of justice\n- According to the code, people are divided into two genders and three classes: superior people, commoners and slaves\n- dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal.\n- Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity.\n- created equal\n- Creator\n- unalienable rights\n- liberty\n- happiness\n- people were not created\n- They have evolved\n- certainly did not evolve to be ‚Äòequal\n- The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation\n- Evolution is based on difference, not on equality\n- there are no such things as rights in biology\n- Birds fly not because they have a right to fly, but because they have wings\n- And it‚Äôs not true that these organs, abilities and characteristics are ‚Äòunalienable\n- But ‚Äòliberty‚Äô? There is no such thing in biology\n- liberty is something that people invented\n- So here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence translated into biological terms:\n- We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n- We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society\n- The Babylonian king most famous today was Hammurabi\n- Homo sapiens has no natural rights\n- If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn‚Äôt there a danger that our society will collapse\n- an imagined order cannot be sustained by violence alone. It requires some true believers as well\n- Christianity would not have lasted 2,000 years if the majority of bishops and priests failed to believe in Christ. American democracy would not have lasted 250 years if the majority of presidents and congressmen failed to believe in human rights. The modern economic system would not have lasted a single day if the majority of investors and bankers failed to believe in capitalism.\n- How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined\n- Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:\n- The imagined order is embedded in the material world\n- Most Westerners today believe in individualism. They believe that every human is an individual, whose worth does not depend on what other people think of him or her\n- Medieval noblemen did not believe in individualism. Someone‚Äôs worth was determined by their place in the social hierarchy, and by what other people said about them.\n- The imagined order shapes our desires. Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths.\n- Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order‚Äôs most important defences.\n- Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually programmed by the imagined order\n- Let‚Äôs consider, for example, the popular desire to take a holiday abroad.\n- Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can\n- Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible.\n- Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‚Äòmarket of experiences\n- People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism\n    - Tags: [[pink]] \n- The imagined order is inter-subjective\n- An objective phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs\n- The subjective is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual\n- The inter-subjective is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals\n- There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.\n- Empires generate huge amounts of information\n- For millions of years people stored information in a single place ‚Äì their brains. Unfortunately, the human brain is not a good storage device for empire-sized databases, for three main reasons.\n- First, its capacity is limited\n- Secondly, humans die, and their brains die with them\n- Thirdly and most importantly, the human brain has been adapted to store and process only particular types of information.\n    - Note: Those related to survival only\n- But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital ‚Äì numbers\n- The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‚Äòwriting‚Äô.\n- The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems. Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.\n- The earliest Sumerian writing was a partial rather than a full script. Full script is a system of material signs that can represent spoken language more or less completely. It can therefore express everything people can say, including poetry. Partial script, on the other hand, is a system of material signs that can represent only particular types of information, belonging to a limited field of activity.\n- Between 3000 BC and 2500 BC more and more signs were added to the Sumerian system, gradually transforming it into a full script that we today call cuneiform\n- What set apart Sumer, as well as pharaonic Egypt, ancient China and the Inca Empire, is that these cultures\n- developed good techniques of archiving, cataloguing and retrieving written records. They also invested in schools for scribes, clerks, librarians and accountants.\n- The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world\n- Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy\n- A critical step was made sometime before the ninth century AD, when a new partial script was invented, one that could store and process mathematical data with unprecedented efficiency. This partial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from 0 to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even though they were first invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly, modern Arabs use a set of digits that look quite different from Western ones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added to the Arab numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.\n- Writing was born as the maidservant of human consciousness, but is increasingly becoming its master.\n- how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.\n- The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither neutral nor fair. They divided people into make-believe groups, arranged in a hierarchy\n- Yet it is an iron rule of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its fictional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable.\n- Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted\n- others.\n- and foremost, most abilities have to be nurtured and developed. Even if somebody is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and refine their abilities.\n- Whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually depend on their place within their society‚Äôs imagined hierarchy\n- Second, even if people belonging to different classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by different rules\n- Clennon King, a black student who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully committed to a mental asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person must surely be insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of Mississippi\n- Since the biological distinctions between different groups of Homo sapiens are, in fact, negligible, biology can‚Äôt explain the intricacies of Indian society or American racial dynamics.\n- Most sociopolitical hierarchies lack a logical or biological basis ‚Äì they are nothing but the perpetuation of chance events supported by myths.\n- People everywhere have divided themselves into men and women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the Agricultural Revolution.\n- The Bible decrees that ‚ÄòIf a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife‚Äô (Deuteronomy 22:28‚Äì9). The ancient Hebrews considered this a reasonable arrangement.\n- To say that a husband ‚Äòraped‚Äô his wife was as illogical as saying that a man stole his own wallet. Such thinking was not confined to the ancient Middle East. As of 2006, there were still fifty-three countries where a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his wife. Even in Germany, rape laws were amended only in 1997 to create a legal category of marital rape.5\n- significant number of human cultures have viewed homosexual relations as not only legitimate but even socially constructive, ancient Greece being the most notable example. The Iliad does not mention that Thetis had any objection to her son Achilles‚Äô relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was one of the most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and even had her own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn‚Äôt have a fit when her son, Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for dinner.\n- Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition.\n- In truth, our concepts ‚Äònatural‚Äô and unnatural‚Äô are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology\n- There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well.\n- another.\n- Patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial societies. It has tenaciously weathered political upheavals, social revolutions and economic transformations\n- The most common theory points to the fact that men are stronger than women, and that they have used their greater physical power to force women into submission. A more subtle version of this claim argues that their strength allows men to monopolise tasks that demand hard manual labour, such as ploughing and harvesting. This gives them control of food production, which in turn translates into political clout.\n- there simply is no direct relation between physical strength and social power among humans\n- In fact, human history shows that there is often an inverse relation between physical prowess and social power\n- It is therefore only natural that the chain of power within the species will also be determined by mental and social abilities more than by brute force.\n- Another theory explains that masculine dominance results not from strength but from aggression. Millions of years of evolution have made men far more violent than women. Women can match men as far as hatred, greed and abuse are concerned, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing to engage in raw physical violence. This is why throughout history warfare has been a masculine prerogative.\n- the greater the number of wars, the greater men‚Äôs control of society. This feedback loop explains both the ubiquity of war and the ubiquity of patriarchy.\n- A third type of biological explanation gives less importance to brute force and violence, and suggests that through millions of years of evolution, men and women evolved different survival and reproduction strategies\n- The result of these different survival strategies ‚Äì so the theory goes ‚Äì is that men have been programmed to be ambitious and competitive, and to excel in politics and business, whereas women have tended to move out of the way and dedicate their lives to raising children\n- and King\n- In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it\n- In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution outlawed slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment mandated that citizenship and the equal protection of the law could not be denied on the basis of race. However, two centuries of slavery meant that most black families were far poorer and far less educated than most white families. A black person born in Alabama in 1865 thus had much less chance of getting a good education and a well-paid job than did his white neighbours.\n- Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe that blacks really are inferior.\n- On crusade, knights could demonstrate their military prowess and their religious devotion at one stroke. The same contradiction produced military orders such as the Templars and Hospitallers, who tried to mesh Christian and chivalric ideals even more tightly.\n- Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture‚Äôs engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species\n- It‚Äôs such an essential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive dissonance.\n- We would do better to adopt instead the viewpoint of a cosmic spy satellite, which scans millennia rather than centuries. From such a vantage point it becomes crystal clear that history is moving relentlessly towards unity.\n- Homo sapiens evolved to think of people as divided into us and them. ‚ÄòUs‚Äô was the group immediately around you, whoever you were, and ‚Äòthem‚Äô was everyone else. In fact, no social animal is ever guided by the interests of the entire species to which it belongs.\n- The first millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal orders, whose devotees could for the first time imagine the entire world and the entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws. Everyone was ‚Äòus‚Äô, at least potentially. There was no longer ‚Äòthem‚Äô. The first universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.\n- money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.\n- History‚Äôs first known money Sumerian barley money ‚Äì is a good example. It appeared in Sumer around 3000 BC,\n- Barley money was simply barley ‚Äì fixed amounts of barley grains used as a universal measure for evaluating and exchanging all other goods and services. The most common measurement was the sila, equivalent to roughly one litre\n- it was somewhat easier to build trust in barley as the first type of money, because barley has an inherent biological value. Humans can eat it.\n- The real breakthrough in monetary history occurred when people gained trust in money that lacked inherent value, but was easier to store and transport. Such money appeared in ancient Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC. This was the silver shekel.\n- The silver shekel was not a coin, but rather 8.33 grams of silver.\n- the silver shekel had no inherent value\n- When they are used for anything, silver and gold are made into jewellery, crowns and other status symbols ‚Äì luxury goods that members of a particular culture identify with high social status. Their value is purely cultural.\n- Counterfeiting is not just cheating ‚Äì it‚Äôs a breach of sovereignty, an act of subversion against the power, privileges and person of the king. The legal term is lese-majesty (violating majesty), and was typically punished by torture and death.\n- The trust in Rome‚Äôs coins was so strong that even outside the empire‚Äôs borders, people were happy to receive payment in denarii.\n- The name ‚Äòdenarius‚Äô became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued ‚Äòdinars‚Äô. The dinar is still the official name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several other countries.\n- Once trade connects two areas, the forces of supply and demand tend to equalise the prices of transportable goods.\n- may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don‚Äôt know each other and don‚Äôt trust each\n- other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.\n- Money is based on two universal principles:\n  a. Universal convertibility: with money as an alchemist, you can turn land into loyalty, justice into health, and violence into knowledge.\n  b. Universal trust: with money as a go-between, any two people can cooperate on any project.\n- Money has an even darker side. For although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it.\n- It is common nowadays to believe that the market always prevails, and that the dams erected by kings, priests and communities cannot long hold back the tides of money. This is na√Øve. Brutal warriors, religious fanatics and concerned citizens have repeatedly managed to trounce calculating merchants, and even to reshape the economy. It is therefore impossible to understand the unification of humankind as a purely economic process.\n- The ancient Numantians are to this day Spain‚Äôs paragons of heroism and patriotism, cast as role models for the country‚Äôs young people\n- An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify for that designation you have to rule over a significant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a different cultural identity and a separate territory. How many peoples exactly? Two or three is not sufficient. Twenty or thirty is plenty.\n- Second, empires are characterised by flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite. They can swallow and digest more and more nations and territories without altering their basic structure or identity.\n- Empires were one of the main reasons for the drastic reduction in human diversity.\n- Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order.\n- Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of human whims or agreements\n- Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers binding.\n- In order to unite under its aegis a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of human beings, a religion must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary.\n- Much of ancient mythology is in fact a legal contract in which humans promise everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals ‚Äì the first chapters of the book of Genesis are a prime example.\n- Two thousand years of monotheistic brainwashing have caused most Westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. This is an unjust stereotype\n- The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans\n- The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good ‚Äì to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death.\n- The insight of polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance\n- Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‚Äòheretics‚Äô and ‚Äòinfidels‚Äô\n- The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and evangelising god of the Christians.\n- if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion.\n- The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious\n- Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God‚Äôs greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends upon his or her own good deeds magnifies his own importance, and implies that Christ‚Äôs suffering on the cross and God‚Äôs love for humankind are not enough.\n  These\n- On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God‚Äôs love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew‚Äôs Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours. When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican‚Äôs rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the room is currently off-limits to visitors).2 More Christians were killed by fellow Christians in those twenty-four hours than by the polytheistic Roman Empire throughout its entire existence.\n- The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect‚Äôs first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had\n- bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word ‚Äì the gospel ‚Äì about Jesus throughout the world.\n- In one of history‚Äôs strangest twists, this esoteric Jewish sect took over the mighty Roman Empire.\n- Like Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the world, but in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to break out of the deserts of Arabia and conquer an immense empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to India. Henceforth, the monotheist idea played a central role in world history\n- At the beginning of the first century AD, there were hardly any monotheists in the world. Around AD 500, one of the world‚Äôs largest empires ‚Äì the Roman Empire ‚Äì was a Christian polity, and missionaries were busy spreading Christianity to other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa\n- The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults differed little from those of the polytheistic gods.\n- Dualistic religions espouse the existence of two opposing powers: good and evil.\n- Dualism explains that the entire universe is a battleground between these two forces, and that everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle.\n- So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe ‚Äì and He‚Äôs evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.\n- Sometime between 1500 BC and 1000 BC a prophet named Zoroaster (Zarathustra) was active somewhere in Central Asia\n- His creed passed from generation to generation until it became the most important of dualistic religions ‚Äì Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu. Humans had to help the good god in this battle\n- The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It‚Äôs called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.\n- The central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Gautama.\n- Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it?\n- In the end he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one‚Äôs own mind.\n- If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering.\n- But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving?\n- Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question, ‚ÄòWhat am I experiencing now?‚Äô rather than on ‚ÄòWhat would I rather be\n- experiencing?‚Äô It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible\n- When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana\n- Those who have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering.\n- A person who does not crave cannot suffer.\n- Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries to others so that everyone could be freed from suffering. He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.\n- This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law of nature\n- Homo sapiens has a unique and sacred nature that is fundamentally different from the nature of all other beings and phenomena. The supreme good is the good of humanity.\n- In 1507, convinced by these arguments, a respected mapmaker named Martin Waldseem√ºller published an updated world map, the first to show the place where Europe‚Äôs westward-sailing fleets had landed as a separate continent. Having drawn it, Waldseem√ºller had to give it a name. Erroneously believing that Amerigo Vespucci had been the person who discovered it, Waldseem√ºller named the continent in his honour ‚Äì America.\n- There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world, and two of\n- its seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose sole claim to fame is that he had the courage to say, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äô\n- the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.\n- So perhaps happiness is synchronising one‚Äôs personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions\n- dwarfs\n- Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, perhaps the real question facing us is not ‚ÄòWhat do we want to become?‚Äô, but ‚ÄòWhat do we want to want?‚Äô Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven‚Äôt given it enough thought.\n- Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don‚Äôt know what they want?\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/Starting-Strength":{"title":"","content":"# Starting Strength\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://up.bookfusion.com/book/cover/002/409/094/147552b72db1965f.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Rippetoe, Mark]]\n- Full Title: Starting Strength\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Our strength, more than any other thing we possess, still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies.\n- A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong.\n- The part of the rep that causes most of the soreness is the eccentric, or ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù phase of the contraction, where the muscle is lengthening under the load rather than shortening.\n- Exercise methods that produce very high levels of soreness as a constant feature of the program ‚Äì due to random exercise selection that precludes adaptation to the stress ‚Äì can contribute to long-term systemic inflammation, the kind that produces poor health instead of fitness and strength\n- Soreness is an unavoidable part of training, but it should not be sought after as a primary objective and worn as a badge of honor for its own sake.\n- It is extremely important to develop the ability to distinguish between injury pain and normal soreness, since your health and long-term progress depend on it.\n- Humans are not physically normal in the absence of hard physical effort\n- Exercise is not a thing we do to fix a problem ‚Äì it is a thing we must do anyway, a thing without which there will always be problems.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/The-Art-and-Business-of-Online-Writing":{"title":"","content":"# The Art and Business of Online Writing\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-8.18caceaece2b.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Nicolas Cole]]\n- Full Title: The Art and Business of Online Writing\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- At first, I tried to make my blog the go-to resource for high-level gameplay information, breaking down team compositions, winning strategies, and little tricks to give gamers a competitive edge. But over time, I started to realize it wasn‚Äôt the informative stuff that made the front page‚Äîit was drama.\n- More importantly, they wanted to know what some of the best players were like in real life.\n- Watching Ming execute this strategy perfectly, I began to mirror my writing style off his. Every one of his posts was a blend between informative content and controversy-inducing tangents.\n- Everything changed for me when I started incorporating more of my real life into my writing.\n- it was missing the most important piece of the puzzle: there was no social component, no way for readers to explore and discover new, interesting writers. And without this discovery feature, the likelihood of someone coming across my blog was slim to none.\n- The most popular answers, the ones with the most views, upvotes, and comments, weren‚Äôt ‚Äúanswers,‚Äù as much as they were stories\n- I didn‚Äôt need to be an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù to answer those types of questions.\n  I just needed to share my story.\n- Every single question on Quora was a creative writing prompt.\n- For an entire year straight, I challenged myself to write one Quora answer, every single day.\n    - Note: The key to everything awesome is consistency\n- My first Quora answer received a whopping 37 views.\n- Now, this is where most people would have given up\n- Unphased by my first answer‚Äôs performance, I pressed on.\n- I had learned that day at work and using it as inspiration for my writing on Quora.\n- I tried to think about exactly when I had learned the answer to each question, what had happened, what was said to me, when it had ‚Äúclicked,‚Äù and then shared that.\n- The more answers I wrote, the more I learned what topics were resonating with the most people, and the more I started to realize what people really enjoyed about my writing.\n- when I wrote about niche topics, viewership was mediocre\n- But when I wrote about universal life lessons, my writing went viral.\n- January, 2015, I landed on the front page of Reddit.\n- That‚Äôs when I launched www.nicolascole.com\n- Knowing I had a limited window of time to capitalize, I spent that entire weekend putting together a personal website.\n  Not because I wanted to start writing there‚Äîbut because I now had a product to sell.\n- wrote two eBooks: one with all my favorite workout routines, and another with my exact meal plan\n- I stuck with my habit of writing an answer per day, every day‚Äîand even though I never wrote another answer quite as viral as that one, consistency is what kept me growing, growing, growing.\n- My writing career was about to take off.\n  ‚ÄúWe expect our paid columnists to write at least four articles per month,‚Äù the editor said.\n  Feeling like I‚Äôd been playing in the minor leagues and was being offered a contract to play in the NHL, I said, ‚ÄúCan I write thirty?‚Äù\n- Now, most people in my position would have stopped writing on Quora, graduating to writing for a major publication. I didn‚Äôt.\n- I had built a massive following on Quora, and was averaging more than 1.5 million organic views per month, every month, while still having at least one of my answers republished by a major publication every single week. I was on fire, and wasn‚Äôt about to throw all my hard work to the wayside.\n- Instead, I doubled-down on my daily writing habit, and committed to writing one answer on Quora, and one article for Inc Magazine, every single day.\n- I needed to play a more profitable game.\n  On accident, I discovered the world of executive ghostwriting.\n- I‚Äôd ‚Äúbeaten the game‚Äù of online writing.\n  Now, I needed to figure out how I was going to turn all that attention into a full-time income. \n  It was humbling for me to have spent four years on a book, only to release it into the world and sell a couple hundred copies (I couldn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúlive‚Äù off $82.76 per month in royalties).\n- By writing online, you elevate yourself. And when you elevate yourself, you open new doors of opportunity.\n  It took me a long time to realize that writing online isn‚Äôt just for writers.\n- 1. The definition of a blog.\n- The entire purpose of starting a blog, and having people come to your own site, is for two reasons and two reasons only‚Äîand both are inspired by money. First, you either plan on monetizing your website via ads (which is why it‚Äôs so crucial that people read your material on your site, which you own), or second, you plan on using your blog to attract a certain type of customer to your website in order to capture their email address and/or sell them a product, service, etc.\n- But making money from your writing is not the same thing as 1) starting a website monetized through ads (which is a media business) or 2) starting a website that sells a product or service (which could be anything from a physical product to an information product like an online course), which are all different variations of an e-commerce business.\n- Either way, when you start a ‚Äúblog,‚Äù you aren‚Äôt really in the business of writing.\n  You‚Äôre in the business of ads, products, or services.\n- For the vast majority of people, the primary purpose of having a website is to quickly communicate who you are, what you do, and what you have done in the past.\n- In short, it‚Äôs a business card.\n- you‚Äôre\n- 3. The definition of Online Writing.\n- The way I define Online Writing is based on one variable and one variable only:\n  Sharing thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights on a platform that already has an active audience.\n- If you are writing on your own platform hoping an audience will come to you, that‚Äôs Blogging.\n- And if you are bringing your voice to a platform where an audience already exists, that‚Äôs Online Writing.\n- The reason I am so wholeheartedly against blogging as a writing strategy is because starting a blog means starting a new website, and starting a new website means starting with zero traffic.\n- And how do you get traffic to your blog?\n- Spend money on ads\n- Optimize your blog posts for Search Engine Optimization\n- Build a social media following on another platform\n- But here‚Äôs the thing: none of the above have anything to do with sharing your thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights at scale\n- So\n- There are two scenarios where starting with a blog is actually the right decision.\n- The first scenario is if you are a business selling some sort of product or service, and revenue is the primary outcome you are looking to drive.\n- Your blog should become an industry publication, where the purpose of that publication is to tap into search traffic around specific keywords and increase the likelihood of a reader becoming a customer looking to buy your product or service.\n- The second scenario for starting a blog is the solopreneur, the digital marketer, the fitness coach, the individual who is less concerned with sharing his or her own individual insights and perspectives, and instead wants to use writing as a marketing mechanism for their internet business\n- Hubspot, for example\n- One of the best examples I‚Äôve ever seen is a website called Kindlepreneur.\n- Kindlepreneur with Dave Chesson\n- In this sense, Dave‚Äôs blog has almost nothing to do with sharing and scaling his own thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights, and is more centered around building a brand and ‚Äúultimate encyclopedia‚Äù of knowledge for anything related to one singular topic: self-publishing\n- If you are a company with the resources to build and scale your website into an industry publication, you should start a\n- blog. And if you are a solopreneur who wants to ‚Äúown‚Äù a category or niche by creating a directory of knowledge, you should start a blog. But if you don‚Äôt fit within either of these two categories, then blogging is not your best path forward.\n- Now, there is a third scenario where you can be a successful ‚Äúblogger.‚Äù However, it is an outlier scenario, and not one I would recommend. Maybe five or ten years ago. But not anymore.\n  The example that comes to mind here is Mark Manson.\n- The reason I say Manson‚Äôs approach is outdated is because newer, better tools have been created in the past ten years that make the process of building your name, audience, and credibility as a writer exponentially faster.\n- Do you want to build a company and brand, making money selling ads, products, and/or services? Then a website and ‚Äúblog‚Äù makes sense. But if you enjoy writing and want to build a personal brand, position yourself as an authentic voice in your industry, and share your thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights at scale, then do not start a blog.\n- Data is the single greatest indicator of what‚Äôs working (and what isn‚Äôt working) about your writing.\n- There are 2 types of writers today: those who use data to inform and improve their writing, and those who fail.\n- why would a writer wait until the moment they were ready to publish their product to start building their audience? The more logical path forward would be to start writing online, build an audience, learn what people actually wanted from you, and THEN launch your product.\n- The new way to think about being a writer in the digital age is to turn your writing into a data mining machine.\n- 99% of people think they know what they should write about.\n- the brutal truth is, they don‚Äôt\n- before you do anything, before you write your book, before you launch your product, before you think about ‚Äúpositioning yourself,‚Äù you need to write online.\n  Why\n- Writing online, first, reduces your risk\n- Writing online, first, helps you find your voice\n- Writing online, first, builds your audience from day one\n- Writing online, first, will give you insight into what people want:\n- All of a sudden, I was no longer making decisions based on what I thought people wanted.\n  People told me what they wanted‚Äîall I had to do was listen.\n- This is your ‚ÄúWriting Data Flywheel.‚Äù\n  Your ‚ÄúWriting Data Flywheel‚Äù is a mechanism for endless inspiration\n- The sooner you start receiving feedback on your writing, the faster you will grow as a writer\n- Likes = ‚ÄúThis is something I approve of. Nice job.‚Äù\n- Shares = ‚ÄúThis is something more people need to know about. This represents me.\n- Comments = ‚ÄúThis is thought provoking. I agree/disagree, and I want you to know why.\n- Views = ‚ÄúThis strikes a chord. There‚Äôs something valuable here.‚Äù\n- Practicing in public is how you gather that data in the first place.\n- I believe the only way to overcome this fear is to run directly at it.\n- The answer is because they‚Äôre afraid.\n- Now, why don‚Äôt people like this approach?\n- And it‚Äôs in running directly at it that you become the person ‚Äúworth listening to‚Äù in the first place.\n- Writing online is a competition, plain and simple.\n- Chapter 3\n  How The Online Writing Game Works: 7 Levels Of Success\n- Unfortunately, most people don‚Äôt see the internet this way. Instead, their measure for success is more binary. If they write a blog post, they‚Äôve succeeded. If they don‚Äôt write a blog post, they‚Äôve failed\n- And because their measures for success are so black and white, they tend to spend money on all the wrong things to drive exposure, increase their audience, and build their credibility: a better-looking website, a bigger advertising budget, more PR, more promotions, more, more, more.\n- Their biggest problem is the writing itself.\n- Level 1: Conscious vs Unconscious\n- Successful writers play the game of Online Writing consciously. Unsuccessful writers play the game unconsciously‚Äîand then wonder why they aren‚Äôt succeeding.\n- I‚Äôm telling you that by playing the game with intention, and paying attention to the data, you will discover and amplify your most authentic writing voice ten times faster.\n- Choose A Category\n- Most people have no idea what category they‚Äôre actually writing in.\n- the ENTIRE‚Äîart and business and ‚Äúgame‚Äù of online writing is rooted in understanding what category you‚Äôre actually competing within. Unless you can consciously name the category, you will never have a firm grasp as to whether your work is ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù or ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù than the competition\n- Categories are how we organize information in our minds. Know your category and you‚Äôll know where readers ‚Äúfit‚Äù you into their own minds.\n- Your job is to take the time to read, observe, and study your chosen category to the point where you understand its native language. You should be able to hear the nuances in how people communicate\n- Level 3: Define Your ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù (Where Do You Sit On The Writing Spectrum?)\n- this.\n- Educating \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\u003e Entertaining\n- Creating a unique, memorable, and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù writing style is nothing more than a deliberate choice to sit somewhere unexpected on this Writing Spectrum\n- The more unexpected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to stand out.\n- On the other hand, the more expected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to sound like everyone else‚Äîand blend into the noise.\n- The secret to creating a unique writing style is by doing what\n- would be considered ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù in your chosen category\n- I cannot\n- My recommendation would be for you to get started writing, publishing, gathering data, ‚Äúpracticing in public,‚Äù and studying The Ladder of your chosen category\n- Level 4: Optimize Your Writing Style For Speed\n- If your story is reliant on the reader making it past the first few pages, then chances are, your story doesn‚Äôt need those pages.‚Äù\n- I would just start with the main point instead\n- The Rate of Revelation.\n- This is the rate at which you reveal new information to the reader\n- Level 5: Specificity Is The Secret\n- The inverse rule of ‚ÄúSpecificity is the Secret,‚Äù is ‚ÄúThe Broader You Are, The More Confusing You Are.‚Äù\n- Ineffective writing is nothing more than writing that does not resonate. And the reason it doesn‚Äôt resonate is almost always a reflection of specificity‚Äîor lack thereof\n- A lot of aspiring writers shy away from naming their writing that specifically, because\n- they\n- But especially when you‚Äôre first starting out online, a box is exactly what you want. You want people to know where to put you on the bookshelf in their mind.\n- For example:\n  ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù is broad. ‚ÄúContent Marketing‚Äù is more specific.\n  ‚ÄúContent Marketing‚Äù is still too broad. ‚ÄúContent Marketing For High-Growth Businesses‚Äù is more specific.\n  ‚ÄúContent Marketing For High-Growth Businesses‚Äù is still too broad. ‚ÄúContent Marketing For Founders And Executives Of High-Growth Businesses‚Äù is more specific.\n    - Note: Justin welsh has exactly the same example On his website\n- Either this is going to be exactly what they‚Äôre looking for, or they‚Äôre going to know right away I‚Äôm not the right writer for them\n- the more specific I am, the more I as a writer also gain clarity around what it is I‚Äôm actually writing about\n- Marketing is a great way to build exposure,‚Äù is a broad statement. ‚ÄúContent marketing is a great way to build exposure for your business‚Äù is more specific.\n  ‚ÄúContent marketing is a great way to build exposure for your business,‚Äù is still a broad statement. ‚ÄúContent marketing\n- the more specific you can be, the more likely you are to resonate with your target reader MORE than your competition.\n- The real question you should never stop asking yourself is, ‚ÄúCould this be more specific?‚Äù Because\n- Start\n- Level 6: Engineering Credibility\n- Luckily, how you build credibility on the internet is easy. In the simplest way, signals of credibility are nothing more than subtle (or not-so-subtle) signs that you know what you‚Äôre talking about and are ‚Äúworth‚Äù listening to.\n- The first layer is Implied Credibility\n- Implied Credibility is how much ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù or ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù your content is than everyone else‚Äôs in your chosen category\n- Your content is so good, your credibility is implied.\n- The second layer is Perceived Credibility.\n- Profile picture\n- Bio\n- Production quality\n- Grammar\n- Organization of thought\n- Specificity\n- What credible people have to say about your writing\n- Which major publications your writing has appeared in\n- How many followers you have on social media\n- High barrier-to-entry products\n- Badges and achievements\n- How much money you‚Äôve made from your craft\n- What so many people fail to realize is that these signals can also backfire‚Äîand they backfire often.\n- you skip straight to this step in the game (and so, so, so many people do), chances are, every person whose attention you capture is going to be disappointed. They‚Äôre going to know, within the first three paragraphs of reading your writing, whether or not they‚Äôve been tricked\n- You might have captured their attention‚Äîbut you certainly didn‚Äôt keep it.\n- The third layer is Earned Credibility.\n- This is the most undervalued form of credibility on the internet.\n  It‚Äôs also the easiest to acquire.\n- the reason we choose to pay attention to some people and choose not to pay attention to other people is not because of Perceived Credibility\n- It‚Äôs actually their Implied Credibility (quality of content) and Earned Credibility (proof they‚Äôre ‚Äúplaying and winning the game‚Äù).\n- What hooks us is their consistency, their improvement over time, and most importantly, their ability to create something that resonates with us in that particular category.\n- long you‚Äôve been creating content for\n- How often you create content\n- How much content you‚Äôve created\n- How many people consume your content\n- How well one of your pieces of content has performed\n- something uniquely different that comes with these badges, in the sense that each is a reflection of effort, skill, and self-discipline.\n- What makes a badge of credibility valuable isn‚Äôt really the badge itself. It‚Äôs how the writer chooses to wear it.\n- The moment you have even one signal of Earned Credibility, you should start leveraging it\n- If one of your articles gets 10,000 views, you should have a link in your bio saying, ‚ÄúRead my most-popular article with more than 10,000 views.‚Äù\n- Level 7: Create Your Own Category\n- Competing in other people‚Äôs categories sucks.\n- The answer is to create a new category of your own.\n- Pop Science\n- Gladwell, instead of competing in either of these two categories, created his own‚Äîwhich the media has since referred to as ‚ÄúPop Science.‚Äù His books are based on thorough research, but they‚Äôre written for a non-academic audience.\n- No-Bullshit Self-Help\n- but it wasn‚Äôt until Jen Sincero published You Are A Badass, and Mark Manson published The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck, that a whole new niche emerged: telling people how to un-fuck their lives, plain and simple\n- Fratire\n- Before Tucker Max‚Äôs, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell, there was ‚Äúsatire,‚Äù and there were fraternity stories told around bonfires while drinking Natty Light\n- The real reason Max became a #1 New York Times best-selling author was because he had created a completely new category\n- Do I want to keep trying to be a ‚ÄòBetter‚Äô version of someone else? Or is it time I become a new and DIFFERENT version of myself?‚Äù\n  And DIFFERENT always beats ‚ÄúBetter.‚Äù\n- Categories are created at unlikely intersections, spotted by writers with an intimate understanding of one or multiple sub-categories\n- The fact that my top 10 highest-performing articles are predominantly about personal development should tell you something. These weren‚Äôt articles about me‚Äîthese were articles about you, the reader. These were pieces to get you thinking, to make you more productive, to help your life in some way. And it was because I was putting the reader first that my articles performed so well. Anytime I shifted the focus to myself, or leaned too heavily into my own ‚Äúnavel gazing,‚Äù viewership fell.\n- Trying to become a popular YouTuber today is much more difficult than it was 10 years ago. We‚Äôre seeing the same thing happen in 2020 with podcasts on Apple and Spotify. It‚Äôs much harder to start a popular podcast today than it was five years ago\n- Phase 1: New website or platform is invented‚Äîearly audiences flock\n- Phase 2: Website or platform starts gaining traction‚Äîearly users become ‚Äúinfluencers\n- Phase 3: Website or platform is established and begins a decade-long journey to profitability\n- Whenever I look for new platforms to leverage as a writer, this is the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù I look for. Because this ‚Äúwindow‚Äù provides maximum upside for content creators\n- The reason is because as soon as a platform reaches this stage, it needs to achieve certain exposure and engagement metrics in order to warrant turning on its advertising machine\n- What these social platforms then do is begin prioritizing their high-volume and high-engagement content creators, giving them more and more exposure in user feeds‚Äîbecause they want to ensure engagement metrics remain high. In addition, because there isn‚Äôt any advertising on the site or in-feed yet, there is dramatically less friction between you and the people who follow you.\n- Phase 4: Advertising model is launched and user reach starts falling.\n- As soon as advertising begins on a platform, you can expect your reach to fall\n- When a platform monetizes with ads, what happens is they have to start picking and choosing which content to show users in their feeds\n- Without ads, you might have seen 20 potential pieces of content in the three minutes you spent scrolling. But with ads, you might only see 15 pieces of content, with 5 ads sprinkled in. Well, where did the other 5 pieces of content go? They‚Äôre still somewhere on the site, they‚Äôre just not being prioritized‚Äîwhich means those content creators are getting less views.\n  This is what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúthrottling.\n- Substack is aiming to be the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù writing platform for paid newsletters. The reason I say ‚Äúsocial‚Äù is because, unlike true social platforms where the purpose is to browse and scroll, Substack actually operates much closer to a tool for writers rather than a social environment (in the sense that there isn‚Äôt an algorithmic feed where you can consume new content, follow writers, etc.). However, the fact that they allow users to loosely browse newsletter creators tells me the social component of their site will develop over time.\n- This means some very smart people are betting on the growth of the category of ‚Äúpaid newsletters‚Äù for writers and media creators.\n- Deciding to start writing online is one thing.\n  Not giving up is entirely another.\n  The unfortunate reality is that most of us suffer from ‚Äúinstant gratification syndrome\n- There is no such thing as, ‚ÄúI wrote my first piece and received 10 million views.‚Äù If that‚Äôs your expectation, get it out of your head now.\n- Writing online requires an unrelenting commitment to consistency.\n- If your goal is to be a successful writer, then social platforms are for publishing first, and consuming second.\n- I have a rule I live by, and it goes like this:\n  ‚ÄúThe number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.‚Äù\n- You don‚Äôt become a writer by reading other writers. \n  You become a writer by writing‚Äîa lot.\n- The more you write, the more data you will accumulate, the better your skills will get, the faster you will learn\n- Stage 1: Just Start Writing\n- Stage 2: Write Consistently For 6 Months And Then Make A Decision\n- Part of getting started writing online means acknowledging that whatever it is you publish today will not be the single greatest thing you ever write. In fact, if it was, I‚Äôd make the argument you have an even worse problem on your hands. Instead of getting better over time, you‚Äôre going to get worse.\n- The writers who become successful aren‚Äôt necessarily the most talented writers.\n  The writers who become successful are the most consistent writers.\n- It‚Äôs impossible to know whether or not you have something meaningful\n- to say, or if a platform is worth writing on, unless you give yourself six months to find out\n- Goal #1: See whether or not you can be consistent.\n- The minimum amount you should be writing and publishing new material online is once per month. That is the absolute minimum\n- My true ‚Äúrecommended minimum‚Äù however is to publish something once every other week.\n- In order to be taken seriously on the internet as an authority in your category and a leader in your industry, niche, or genre, you need to be writing and publishing new material 2x\n- per month\n- And if you really want to beat the game of capturing and keeping attention, if you truly want the most guaranteed path to success, then you need to be writing and publishing something new several times per week‚Äîor ideally, every single day.\n- First, think of a social media algorithm as a roulette wheel\n- Every time you create a new piece of content, you are pushing that content into the social platform‚Äôs algorithm and ‚Äúspinning the wheel.‚Äù\n- Second, readers are fickle. So are viewers, listeners, and consumers of any type of content\n- If my favorite content creator stops playing the game, I‚Äôm not going to sit around and wait for them to come back\n- For this reason alone, you have to understand that in order to be ‚Äúseen‚Äù as a credible, consistent source of information, you need to prove to audience members you‚Äôre going to be there for them and with them, day in and day out.\n- Third, you have no idea which one of your creations is going to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù that takes off\n- Goal #2: Start gathering data about what your most popular categories are.\n- your first six months of writing online, you should be less concerned with ‚Äúestablishing‚Äù yourself and more focused on ‚Äúdiscovering‚Äù yourself.\n- The way we would engineer this process for our clients at Digital Press is we would come up with three categories (‚ÄúContent Buckets‚Äù) that represented who they were and what they wanted to write about.\n- We would then begin writing and publishing content in all three of these different categories, alternating back and forth until we started to see patterns emerge.\n- We were running an experiment. And what we usually found was, the topics they thought people would want to hear about from them weren‚Äôt actually the topics data told us were most engaging\n- Once data enters the equation, this is where the ‚ÄúWho Do I Want To Be?‚Äù conversation gets interesting. Do you want to keep writing what you had originally wanted to write about? Or do you want to write what people clearly want more of?\n- My answer is: you should always do both\n- Data doesn‚Äôt lie. But data is also a reflection of the external crowd, and not necessarily your internal compass\n- Let data tell you your next move, give people exactly what they want, and win the game.\n    - Note: Option 1\n- ignore the data\n    - Note: Option 2\n- there is a third option, and that‚Äôs to optimize the former so you can introduce people to the latter.\n- Goal #3: Pay close attention to writers at the top of the hierarchy of the social platform‚Äîand constantly measure yourself against their performance.\n- If you want to surpass even the most popular, highest-performing writers within an existing category, all you have to do is everything they‚Äôre doing, more consistently.\n- Your job is to study the competition and understand exactly why they are succeeding in the first place.\n- Question everything. Nothing a creator does repeatedly is accidental.\n- These unspoken ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù exist on every single platform\n- Your job is to find the common threads, make them part of your own strategy, and then slowly over time create a style and category of your own\n- Stage 3: Once You‚Äôve Proven You Can Be Consistent, Pour Some Gasoline On Your Fire And Go KABOOM!\n- If\n- However, if you‚Äôre unable to be consistent for six months, if you‚Äôre incapable (no matter how hard you try) to write on a regular basis, I have some bad news for you:\n  You‚Äôre not a writer.\n- So, if you can‚Äôt be consistent for six months, either realize you love the idea of being seen as a writer more than you love sitting down and writing and move on to something else, OR, try again.\n  Pinpoint your mistakes.\n  Be honest about why you weren‚Äôt able to remain consistent.\n- Consistent output is the secret to every growth metric on the internet: Views, Comments, Likes, Shares, etc.\n- Audience Hacking means collaborating with another writer who has a similar audience to you‚Äîintroducing your audience to them and their audience to you\n- Once you have a sound foundation as a consistent writer on the internet, now you can begin adding in all the fun growth strategies that start to separate amateur writers from professional writers.\n- Audience Hacking\n- Collaborations could include:\n  Co-authoring an article together\n  You interviewing them, and them interviewing you\n  You sharing one of their articles, them sharing one of your articles\n  You both meeting up in real life, taking a picture or shooting a short video clip together, posting it and tagging each other\n  You giving them a testimonial, and them giving you a testimonial\n- It‚Äôs an incredibly effective way to market yourself to new audiences while at the same time creating content that is different and maybe even better than what you could otherwise create on your own.\n- Trend Jacking\n- Trend Jacking is probably the easiest, most common growth hack on the internet.\n- Trend Jacking is where you hop on someone else‚Äôs train in order to bring some of that heightened attention back to yourself.\n- Engagement Hacking\n- This growth tactic can be very tedious, but it works extremely well.\n- Engagement Hacking is where you engage with the audiences of other writers, introducing them to your own writing.\n- The first step is to make a list of other writers within your chosen category\n- Once you have a list of ten or fifteen writers (ideally with audiences similar and slightly larger than your own), go to each of their profiles and start commenting on recent content they‚Äôve published‚Äîor, even better, respond to someone else‚Äôs comment on their content\n- The whole idea here is to get your name in front of the same people who are actively looking for the type of content you write\n- Hashtag Stacking\n- Most people don‚Äôt know how hashtags actually work.\n- The biggest mistake people make when using hashtags is treating them as words and phrases within their actual message\n- you are writing or sharing links to your writing on platforms that use hashtags, the correct way to do hashtag stacking is to do a little research before you post‚Äîso you can tag your content with popular, relevant folders. First, go back to your list of popular writers within your chosen category. What hashtags are they using? Why are they using them?\n- The second step is to then create different tiers of folders for your posts to be organized within. When you click on a hashtag on any social platform, you can see how many people are currently using that hashtag. What you want to do is tag your posts with a blend of both large, popular hashtags and smaller, niche hashtags\n- The reason I like tagging posts with both broad and niche hashtags is because it gives each post a chance to be exposed to the masses, and to be found by highly targeted readers\n- entire secret to getting exposure on your writing online is to find as many ways as possible to make your writing resonate both on a broad level and with a specific audience at the same time\n- Publishing Hacking\n- One of the biggest benefits to building a vast library of content for yourself is the fact that you can continue to leverage that library over and over again.\n- The bigger you build your library of content, especially when your content is more timeless than timely, the more you can continue to engage your audience well into the future. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with sharing an article you wrote three years ago‚Äîespecially if it‚Äôs a great article.\n- Delete your original post, change a variable or two, and publish it again.\n- Maybe you published it during an unlucky time of day. Maybe your original title didn‚Äôt have the right hook. Maybe you realized after the fact that your post could have been flushed out further. Whatever the reason, there are no rules against deleting your original post and republishing it with a different set of variables\n- My personal advice is to avoid publishing and deleting content as often as possible\n- Instead, I‚Äôm a big believer in just re-writing a new and improved version and publishing a second piece instead\n- Build syndication relationships with websites and major publications, and get around the ‚Äúduplicate content‚Äù rule\n- 100,000 views, I thought it wasn‚Äôt a winner. Then it got syndicated by Business Insider and it went crazy. Which is why it‚Äôs to your advantage to have your content appear in as many places as possible on the internet. You never know which environment is going to be the one that makes it ‚Äúgo.‚Äù\n- However, the ‚Äúcon‚Äù of this strategy is what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúduplicate content.‚Äù\n- Duplicate content‚Äù is the terminology Google uses to explain their ranking system‚Äîand their dislike for seeing the same exact content on multiple websites.\n- The only time you should be worrying about duplicate content (which means: the same exact content appearing on multiple, different websites) is if you are writing with a heavy focus on SEO\n- In short: writers who fear ‚Äúduplicate content‚Äù think they‚Äôre doing the right thing, not realizing they‚Äôre actually playing a completely different game\n- The beginner version of this strategy is to post every single article you write on every single social platform you can\n- Every time I write an answer on Quora, for example, I will copy/paste that answer, give it a headline, and also publish it on Medium. Then\n- I‚Äôll take that Medium article, copy/paste it, and publish it on LinkedIn. And I‚Äôll keep doing this with as many social platforms as I can, where publishing articles of that quality is acceptable.\n- The advanced version of this strategy is to reach out to websites and publications and let them know you are writing content that aligns with their target audience, and that you‚Äôd be willing to let them syndicate your content for free\n- The expert version of this strategy is the advanced version at the publication level.\n- There are five types of writing on the internet.\n  Form #1: Actionable Guide\n  Form #2: Opinion\n  Form #3: Curated List\n  Form #4: Story\n  Form #5: Credible Talking Head\n- The way you ‚Äúwin‚Äù the game of online writing is by creating the single best possible version of whatever form of writing you‚Äôre using in your chosen category.\n- The very first question you should ask is, ‚ÄúWhat type of writing is this?‚Äù\n- The second question you should ask is, ‚ÄúHow can I make this the ULTIMATE guide to writing online?‚Äù\n- Your goal should be to create a guide so specific, so comprehensive, so informative, that the moment a reader starts reading what you‚Äôve written, they will immediately 1) bookmark it, 2) share it with someone else, and 3) feel as though they don‚Äôt need to go read any other guides, articles, or eBooks on the same topic.\n- This requires research. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to know whether or not you‚Äôve successfully ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù the competition if you have no idea who your competition is in the first place. So, poke around the internet. Google the topic you want to write about, along with a handful of related topics. Read a few other people‚Äôs ‚Äúultimate guides,‚Äù and see if you can pinpoint where they went wrong, or where you (as the reader) wished they had gone more in depth.\n- the third question you need to ask yourself is, ‚ÄúCan I make this more specific? Am I trying to cram too much into one article?‚Äù\n- You aren‚Äôt aiming for a word count. What you‚Äôre aiming for is the most value you can possibly deliver WITHOUT 1) confusing the reader, or 2) wasting their time.\n- The usual mistake writers make here is they try to fit too many ideas into one single piece of content.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/The-Comfort-Crisis":{"title":"","content":"# The Comfort Crisis\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication124/v4/95/c6/a1/95c6a19f-7193-81c8-1c3e-ac41f59a2436/9780593138779.d.jpg/1875x2850bb.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Michael Easter]]\n- Full Title: The Comfort Crisis\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- He called this ‚Äúprevalence-induced concept change.‚Äù Essentially ‚Äúproblem creep.‚Äù It explains that as we experience fewer problems, we don‚Äôt become more satisfied.

Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.\n- focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.\n- people who have control over their time tend to be happier in life is a broad and common enough observation that you can do something with it.\n- The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won‚Äôt wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.\n- But more important is that as much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures.\n- Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, ‚ÄúYes, but I have something he will never have ‚Ä¶ enough.‚Äù\n- There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt need.\n- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.\n- Social comparison is the problem here\n- It gets dangerous when the taste of having more‚Äîmore money, more power, more prestige‚Äîincreases ambition faster than satisfaction.\n- The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it‚Äôs a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with‚Äîto accept that you might have enough, even if it‚Äôs less than those around you.\n- ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù is not too little.\n- There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.\n- The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference.\n- More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I‚Äôm unbreakable I actually think I‚Äôll get the biggest returns, because I‚Äôll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.\n- Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.\n- A barbelled personality‚Äîoptimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future‚Äîis vital.\n- Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.\n- A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.\n- The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, ‚ÄúI can do whatever I want today.‚Äù\n- The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.\n- Money‚Äôs greatest intrinsic value‚Äîand this can‚Äôt be overstated‚Äîis its ability to give you control over your time.\n- The most powerful common denominator of happiness was simple. Campbell summed it up:\n- Having a strong sense of controlling one‚Äôs life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.\n- Using\n- your money to buy time and options has a lifestyle benefit few luxury goods can compete with.\n- But doing something you love on a schedule you can‚Äôt control can feel the same as doing something you hate.\n- There is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it reactance\n- No one‚Äînot a single person out of a thousand‚Äîsaid that to be happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want.\n- No one‚Äînot a single person‚Äîsaid it‚Äôs important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they do it‚Äôs real success.\n- No one‚Äînot a single person‚Äîsaid you should choose your work based on your desired future earning power.\n- What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. ‚ÄúYour kids don‚Äôt want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,‚Äù Pillemer writes.\n- Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.\n- the truth is that wealth is what you don‚Äôt see.\n- More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.\n- A question you should ask as the range of your competition expands is, ‚ÄúHow do I stand out?‚Äù\n- In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills‚Äîlike communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility.\n- Richard Feynman, the great physicist, once said, ‚ÄúImagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.‚Äù\n- The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‚ÄòThe four most dangerous words in investing are, ‚Äòit‚Äôs different this time.‚Äô‚Äù\n- The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‚Äòit‚Äôs different this time.‚Äô‚Äù\n- History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas\n- the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary\n- Having a gap between what you can technically endure versus what‚Äôs emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error.\n- Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science\n- assume the future returns I‚Äôll earn in my lifetime will be ‚Öì lower than the historic average\n- Leverage is the devil here. Leverage‚Äîtaking on debt to make your money go further‚Äîpushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin.\n- You have to survive to succeed\n- The ability to do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want, has an infinite ROI.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.041509536Z","tags":null},"/Readwise/Books/The-Third-Door":{"title":"","content":"# The Third Door\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication128/v4/20/ee/23/20ee23a2-65e6-ed29-77be-ac5f5b57f3a3/9780804136679.jpg/1688x2548bb.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Alex Banayan]]\n- Full Title: The Third Door\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- ‚ÄúYou may have the heart‚Äîyou keep fighting, you keep fighting, you keep fighting‚Äîbut your mind is saying, ‚ÄòMan, forget this.

Take long walks\n  For each of these legends, daily walks were the *staple* of their creative process.\n  ‚Ä¢ Thinking\n  ‚Ä¢ Listening\n  ‚Ä¢ Outlining\n  ‚Ä¢ Observing\n  95% of their writing happened during long walks.\n  By the time they sat down to type, they knew exactly what to say. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620543534407680))\n- 2. Capture ideas‚Äîeverywhere\n  The world's biggest lie:\n  \"I'll remember that idea later.\"\n  Each of these great writers treated every idea as *precious* and captured it immediately.\n  ‚Ä¢ Quick capture on their phone\n  ‚Ä¢ Whiteboards in the shower\n  ‚Ä¢ Notebooks all over the place ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620548500455426))\n- These first 2 daily habits made coming up with ideas *easy* ‚Äî something that happened with zero effort.\n  By simply going about their day, their brain was free to think creatively.\n  Staring at a blank page?\n  Never a problem for them.\n  Now, onto their daily writing routines: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620553495842817))\n- 3. Write on a timer‚Äîevery day\n  Jerry Seinfeld‚Äîa billion-dollar comedian.\n  Gary Halbert‚Äîa billion-dollar copywriter.\n  Both of these legends had a simple routine with 1 rule.\n  1. Set a timer for 33:33\n  2. During that time, you could do anything except get out of your chair \n  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYwELAdWIAQpsM-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620561523687424))\n- And this took the pressure off writing.\n  For the first few minutes, they would stare at the wall.\n  Sip their coffee.\n  Think about all the other thing they would rather be doing.\n  But at some point, they'd start writing.\n  And the timer let they know the torture would end soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620566779142145))\n- During their breaks, they would walk around, have a quick snack, and do anything else but write.\n  And during this time, inspiration always struck.\n  Then, at the end of the day, they wouldn't say \"I wrote until I got tired.\"\n  They would say \"I wrote for six sessions today.\" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620571745296385))\n- This made it easy to keep momentum.\n  The timer made it easy to get started, and the daily recap made them feel a sense of accomplishment.\n  Day by day, these sessions compounded.\n  But aside from the timer, there was one more common trait: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620576728137729))\n- 4. Ruthlessly block distractions\n  95% of writing is simply avoiding the internet's distractions.\n  So these writers would go a long way to isolate themselves from the notifications, pings, and interruptions.\n  ‚Ä¢ Secluded hotels\n  ‚Ä¢ Cabins in the woods\n  Anything to avoid the noise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620581648011265))\n- So far we've talked about:\n  1. Taking long walks\n  2. Capturing ideas everywhere\n  3. Writing on a timer\n  4. Avoiding distractions\n  These are enough for any beginner to get started.\n  But it's the last 2 steps that turn *average* writing into *legendary* writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620586613997568))\n- 5. Be 100% content to appear clueless.\n  Each of these writers had a complete lack of ego.\n  They were endlessly curious‚Äînever afraid to ask \"stupid\" questions.\n  This made them learning machines, always inhaling new information.\n  And you *felt* this curiosity in their writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620591739736064))\n- Without an ego, these writers would dive head first into any new topic as a complete beginner.\n  By learning and studying different topics \u0026 fields, they could combine ideas in a way no one else could.\n  The smaller the ego, the better the writer.\n  Which takes us to the 6th step: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620596844007425))\n- 6. Constantly seek objective feedback\n  Most writers never hit publish because they're a \"perfectionist.\"\n  But perfectionism is 100% an ego problem.\n  You are you assuming people are going to comb your every word, waiting for mistakes.\n  Newsflash: they aren't.\n  Instead, do this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620601881333760))\n- ‚Ä¢¬†Hit publish before it's ready\n  The truth is, your writing will never be ready.\n  So get it out into the world.\n  Then, listen carefully to what your readers have to say.\n  ‚Ä¢ Don't ask for feedback‚Äîask for advice\n  People are uncomfortable giving feedback, so ask for it like this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620606843195398))\n- When getting advice (instead of feedback), Tim Ferriss requests the reader highlight:\n  ‚Ä¢¬†Anywhere boring\n  ‚Ä¢¬†Anything confusing\n  ‚Ä¢ Anywhere your mind starts to wander\n  Then he asks two questions - what is the:\n  ‚Ä¢ 10% I must keep\n  ‚Ä¢¬†20% I should cut immediately ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620611775651848))\n- Boom ‚Äì¬†that's it!\n  And here's the 1 big realization you should have from this thread:\n  The best writing is not a result.\n  It's a byproduct.\n  By carefully crafting (and following) a daily writing system, great writing is guaranteed.\n  And these legends provide the best example! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620616750186496))\n- In summary, to be a great writer, do these 6 things every day:\n  1. Take long walks\n  2. Capture ideas everywhere\n  3. Write on a timer‚Äîevery day\n  4. Ruthlessly avoid distractions\n  5. Be 100% content to appear clueless\n  6. Seek feedback objectively\n  Now, get going!

If simple words were enough for Hemingway, they‚Äôre enough for you.\n  2. The best market research tool was invented thousands of years ago: talking to your customers. Get your finger on the heartbeat of your customer‚Äôs problems. Otherwise, you‚Äôre shooting in the dark.\n  3. Thinking in headlines will make you a clearer thinker. It will help you see how an idea should be framed, identify different ways to tell your story, and show you the soul of your topic.\n  4. Sam says: ‚ÄúI firmly believe in putting my back against the wall.‚Äù Deadlines, pressure, and harsh goals will pull out the best from you.\n  5. Short attention spans aren‚Äôt the problem people think they are. Some of the most popular online essays are longer than 5,000 words. There are other data points too. Rogan has the world‚Äôs biggest podcast. Popular standup specials on Netflix are sometimes 90 minutes long. The problem is that your content isn‚Äôt good enough. \n  6. How do you make it good enough? Sam tells writers to make their work ‚Äúslippery.‚Äù Cut the fluff. Make it move. Keep the energy high.\n  7. When you start writing and don't have an audience, go to where your readers are and do the work of telling them about you. Look for Internet subcommunities where you can reach your readers. Find the people who want what you have, but just don‚Äôt know about you yet. While starting The Hustle, Sam went to the *r/selfpublishing* on Reddit.\n  8. Sam Parr copied the best sales letters of all time by hand. Let the writing you admire pass through your fingers, fall out of your pen‚Äîand you will discover the heartbeat of eloquence. This method is called copywork. \n  9. Speaking of copywork... if musicians learn music by copying other musicians, why don't writers learn writing by copying other writers? \n  10. Most people suck at writing because they‚Äôre scared. ‚ÄúWill people like my article?‚Äù they say. That's loser talk. The only way to get past this is to toughen up. Come at your keyboard with boldness. Pounce on it. Timidity is the enemy.\n  11. The optimal post length is shorter than 500 words or more than 2,000 words. Don‚Äôt bother with anything in between.\n  12. To improve your company‚Äôs copy, look at what big companies had on their site before they got big. Use the Internet Archive. Study their branding. Copy their design. Dissect their word choice. Most companies are sharper and more focused in the early days before design-by-committee becomes a plague.\n  13. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre easy to *read*, if you‚Äôre also easy to *forget*. Aim to get stuck in your readers‚Äô mind like a catchy song. Be easy to read, but hard to forget.\n  14. To see what hard to forget writing looks like, study this popular line from the Bible: \"Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" Notice how the word day reappears in daily, and the word trespass is used twice. This practice of repeating words with intention is called ‚Äúpolyptoton‚Äù and makes for stickier writing‚Ä¶\n  15. Just like you should look at what big companies did before they got big, you should look at the habits of successful people before they got big. A 13 year old basketball player should look at what Lebron James was doing at 13, not what he‚Äôs doing today. There‚Äôs more alpha in the ‚Äúearly career‚Äù part of all outlier success stories.\n  16. Sam Parr‚Äôs mantra for business (which he has tattooed on his thigh): ‚ÄúBold. Fast. Fun.‚Äù It‚Äôs really hard to beat someone who moves fast, takes risks, and has fun doing it.\n  17. Sam Parr‚Äôs favorite business book: How To Get Rich by Felix Dennis. Sam says it has the best information, perspectives and stories for those who want to make $ via starting a business.\n  18. If you're making a sales page, use the AIDA framework. The hook is for getting Attention, the content is for generating Interest, the conclusion is for inciting Desire, and the CTA is for inspiring Action.\n  19. Book recommendation for anybody who wants to write more memorably: The Elements of Eloquence.\n  @thesamparr can write, sell, and entertain. \n  Come for the writing, stay for the stories about women who want to sleep with werewolves and the time he crossed paths with a soon-to-be convicted felon.

Search around.\n  Is anyone asking about these things?\n  Try using Advanced X search and typing in ‚Äúdoes anyone know how to‚Äù and then adding a keyword like \"newsletter\" or \"SEO\".\n  You'll likely find people struggling with something you excel at. That's your cue.\n  Once you've identified a \"basic\" skill people want to learn, draft up 10-15 pieces of content that show your expertise.\n  For example, the other day on LinkedIn, I shared a long post about the different types of website traffic and how to get some: Direct, organic, social, etc.\n  In my mind, this is the most basic information in the world.\n  Everyone probably knows this stuff ‚Äî right?\n  Well, it turns out that 121,144 people found it useful enough to read and 800+ of them signed up for my newsletter.\n  If I wanted, I could likely build a low-cost product that helped people increase their web traffic.\n  If your content starts getting some traction, consider stepping it up another notch.\n  Create a one-pager or a video explaining the basics of your skill. Turn it into a lead magnet that people can access.\n  You‚Äôll start to collect email addresses of people who could be your ideal customers.\n  **Here's the most important step:**\n  Once they‚Äôve accessed it, send them an automated email and ask them what their 3 biggest challenges are related to your skill or knowledge.\n  Pipe those answers into AirTable, Google Sheets, or Notion using Zapier.\n  **‚Üë NOBODY does this ‚Üë**\n  These answers can become content, newsletters, products, etc. There‚Äôs so much gold in this information!\n  Hope this gives you something to think about this week.\n  Drop any questions you have below and I‚Äôll do my best to answer today.

But mostly I make the time to get 6 pages in, although entropy tries to intervene‚Äù*\n  No hacks, no shortcuts, just 6 pages a day for 60 days.\n  **Two Lessons to Highlight **üí°\n  1** - King‚Äôs writing goal is an example of a Task System. **He wants to write 6 pages a day, no matter how long that takes. \n  By now he knows it takes 3-4 hours though. The other type of goal is a Time System - write for 1 hour, no matter how words you get.\n  Too many people try to do both at once, and it doesn‚Äôt work well. You can‚Äôt write 1000 words and make it an hour every day. \n  If you have a word/page goal, that has to be the top priority. Most writers‚Äîunless you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbig W‚Äù Writer‚Äîshould have a time goal of writing for 30-60 minutes no matter how many words come out.\n  2** - George RR Martin has made more money and had more success that 99.9% of writers. **But he still has doubts and asks these questions! \n  ‚Äú*Should I have been a plumber?‚Äù *is a wild statement and something that I would never think a person like him would make. It reminds me of the chapter in B*ird by Bird *where Anne Lamott has this to say about ‚Äúshitty first drafts.‚Äù\n  \"*I know some very great writers, writers you love who write beautifully and have made a great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely feeling wildly enthusiastic and confident. Not one of them writes elegant first drafts.

It's usually 3, sometimes 4, and very rarely 5.\n  I never want to end the day with open items, so being conservative helps me accomplish that (and get the extra rush from getting through more than I expected).\n  As I go through the day, I stole an idea from Marc Andreessen to use the back of the card to write down and cross off any minor to-dos that I complete (the urgent or unimportant tasks that are not welcome on the front of the card).\n  The process of writing and crossing off an item on the back of the card is a further boost of momentum, so I find it to be a worthwhile exercise.\n  My notecard productivity system is painfully simple, but it's grounded in five powerful realizations:\n  1. 15 minutes of prep in the evening is worth hours the next morning.\n  By setting out your priority tasks the night before, you eliminate any friction from having to decide what to work on. You hit the ground sprinting.\n  2. Important \u003e Urgent.\n  By tackling the important to start the day, you guarantee progress against the big picture projects and goals.\n  If my day went to hell after that morning focus block (which it sometimes does with a 1-year-old at home!), it would be ok, because I know I've gotten through much of my important work.\n  3. Momentum is everything.\n  Crossing important items off your list to start the day immediately creates a winning feeling that you keep with you. Success begets success.\n  4. Simple is beautiful.\n  If you're spending time thinking about your productivity system, you're studying for the wrong test.\n  That's movement for the sake of movement. You should be focused on progress.\n  5. Find what works for you.\n  It used to stress me out that I didn't have a beautiful productivity system that would impress others. Then I realized that whatever works for me is the best productivity system.\n  Identify how you operate and find the system that works for you.\n  To get started, just buy a stack of simple 3x5 notecards and give it a shot.\n  If you've ever been overwhelmed by productivity systems and advice, this is an approach to try.\n  Follow me @SahilBloom for more ideas like this in the future!

They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10-by-10 feet was worn bare of grass.¬†.¬†.¬†. Perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns.\" *\n  **What past limitations‚Äîreal or perceived‚Äîare you carrying as baggage?

Signal.\n  Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.\n  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down. \n  This allowed me to understand what people cared about.\n  So, I kept writing \u0026 talking about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619399793975296))\n- 3/ Built a service business\n  My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.\n  Founders sent me DMs asking questions. \n  I responded to every single one.\n  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619401601732608))\n- 4/ Found my ideal customers\n  Inside your customer base is more signals.\n  What are the commonalities between the customers you love \u0026 those who love you?\n  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space.

This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.\n  I said no to any company outside of my niche. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619406018322432))\n- 6/ Reduced my time\n  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much. \n  Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.\n  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale income that was more automated.\n  My goal had always been to get my time back.

(VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)\n  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619416453652484))\n- 11/ Tripled down\n  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.\n  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.\n  The earlier $50 price was my \"trust tripwire\".\n  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619418328608768))\n- 12/ Marketed aggressively\n  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.\n  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.\n  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.\n  Next up... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619420329291778))\n- 13/ I began creating an army\n  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial \u0026 sign up for an affiliate program.\n  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.\n  I now have 1,400+ affiliates that have generated $280,000+ in revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619422388633603))\n- 14/ Built a community\n  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.\n  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.\n  I opened a private community for creators and charged $199. \n  Those who completed my course were prompted to join. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619429456105472))\n- 15/ Made a difficult decision\n  I loved my community but realized that it didn't work with my personality.\n  It was a $15k MRR business, but I felt like I had to be \"on\" 24/7.\n  That wasn't the life I wanted to build.\n  15 months after starting it, I made a decision to shut it down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619431314087936))\n- 16/ Reinvested my time\n  With way more free time now, I decided to start Tweeting.\n  Using what I knew about growing on LinkedIn, I was able to hit 75k followers in about 6 months.\n  This provided a new channel to build more stuff.\n  So I did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619433230868483))\n- 17/ Created a 2nd digital course\n  I was doing a podcast with @dickiebush and @nicolascole77 about how I built a system for writing content.\n  The 500+ people on the call seemed to be amazed by it.\n  That led to my 2nd course, The Content Operating System. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619435441287168))\n- 18/ Added MRR\n  I noticed that each week I was spending time creating content templates for myself.\n  What if my audience wanted those too?\n  I tested it as a $9 upsell on each course.\n  8 months later it has 2,100+ subscribers.\n  Almost $19.3k MRR from something I was already doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619437718872065))\n- 19/ Started a newsletter\n  In January of 2022, I launched my newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.\n  I was determined to deliver one piece of actionable advice each Saturday AM that could be read in 4 minutes or less.\n  In the last 17 months, I've grown it to 115k+ subs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619439761489925))\n- 20/ Added sponsorships\n  With over 115k subs, I can charge for each issue to be sponsored.\n  I have 2 slots per issue, per week, that sell for $2,500.\n  Now each weekly newsletter is paying $5,000, and people are getting their brand and business in front of a ton of readers.

I no longer do anything SaaS-related.\n  2. I don't do any paid ads.\n  3. I don't have any full-time employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized and a part-time VA.\n  4.

Instead of creating annual resolutions, which are oft bound to fail due to their rigid nature, a yearly theme is a broad framework that is intended to guide my actions towards my goals.\n\n## Looking back at 2022 themes\n\nIn 2022, I chose two themes to guide me: **Health** and **Music**. I talk about this in my [podcast](https://www.halflife.show/7) in greater depth. I want to reflect on how that worked out for a minute.\n\nIn terms of health, I started resistance training three times a week and that has helped drop my body fat percentange by about 3%. I'm not going to extol the benefits of having lean muscle mass in this article, but it is key to proper hormone regulation and metabolic health. \n\nTo build muscle, I have been targeting about 1g of protein intake per pound of body weight, per day. It has been hard to keep up, unless I include a significant amount of meat in my diet, which I cannot always do for various reasons. I've prioritized sleep over everything else in the evenings, targeting 7+ hours of consistent shut-eye everyday. These health themed lifestyle changes have greatly improved by mood, energy and cognition throughout the day.\n\nMusic has been much harder for me to keep up with consistently. I was not able to adhere to a strict practice schedule, but I did become more concious about improving my technique when I did actually play guitar, instead of noodling away my time. I took a month's worth of lessons with [Straten Marshall](https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall/), and he pointed out that my alternate picking suffered because my hands were not synchronized. It seems obvious in hindsight, but working on that specifically has helped a lot. My alternate picking has gotten a lot cleaner and faster as a result. I have included playing scales and modes in my practice routine. These are boring, but necessary.\n\nPlaying music with others has been a challege, due to time contraints of everybody involved. I have considered [[permanent/using zettelkasten for music composition|an alternate approach]] to music composition based on a [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician|blog article]] I read, but I'll have to see how that works out in practice. I have joined a community rock band to play music with other people, but that has not proved to be challenging or instructive thus far.\n\n## Now, not later\n\nThis is my yearly theme for 2023. As of this writing, I'm about halfway reading [[literature/B-Burkeman-2021|4000 weeks by Oliver Burkeman]], and while I disagree with a lot of his views, I do accept that ==time is finite==. We have about 4000 weeks to live. Too often, I end up delaying things to another time, or working towards a better future without enjoying the now. This is the now. This is it. I'm here. And I've already spent about 2000 weeks of my life.\n\nTo apply this theme, I'm going to have to keep in mind a few key concepts:\n\n1. I have to restrict the number of things I actually pursue. For example, I cannot learn a new programming language, and contribute to open-source projects. Why? Because I am already running a podcast, have a family with young kids, play music, and like to read and write, while having a full time job. This leaves few hours to much else. It's time to accept that.\n2. I have to be fully present in the now and learn to quickly slip into a flow state at whatever I am doing, whether it be office work, music, playing with kids or doing the dishes. No multi-tasking. Minimal distraction.\n3. No more productivity hacks. No hourly planning, to-do lists, pomodoro timers, or overly complex workflows. Daily highlights are okay to keep a focus on what needs to get done. Go through the day giving each task the attention it deserves - no more, no less, and see where things land. Pick up what falls to the wayside at another time.\n4. Apply the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) whenever possible. Be aware that the last 20% of any task takes 80% of the time (that I don't already have.) Be happy with the 80%, while knowing that perfection is admirable but costly.\n5. This one is cheesy, but true. Live everyday like it is your last. This might be the last time I ever did something. Pick up my child, visit Las Vegas, or go surfing. Enjoy and savor every moment because I might never get it again.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIt is necessary to slow down the conveyor belt of tasks that appear in life, and my yearly theme is designed to do that. This does not mean I abandon my previous years' themes entirely when the new one arrives. I will still work on my health and music. I view it as a continuous evolution of myself. I absorb each years theme till it becomes a part of me. This is the only way we can all become better versions of ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.045509538Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allblog":{"title":"All Blog Posts","content":"\n2022-12-19: [[blog/Yearly Themes 2023|Yearly Themes 2023]]\n2022-12-31: [[blog/2022 in Review|2022 in Review]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.045509538Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allpodcast":{"title":"All Podcast Notes","content":"\n[[literature/P-Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health|Huberman Lab Podcast: Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health]]","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.045509538Z","tags":null},"/blog/_now":{"title":"Now","content":"\nüì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices\n\nüéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [Half Life Show](https://www.halflife.show)\n\n‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my [tech blog](https://rfic.io)\n\n## Health\n\nOver the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition.

Regions like the brain have unusual and rather erratic energy needs. The body exclusively relies on glucose for energy.\n\n[[permanent/Glucose is the fundamental means of transporting energy to various parts of the body]] because it is unusally insoluable and can travel well through the blood stream. Think about it as an ideal electron shipping container.\n\n### What is Glycolysis?\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis is the breaking down of a glucose molecule]]\n\nWhen glucose reaches the destination cell, the highest energy electrons are stripped and used to construct a carrier module known as NADH  (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide + Hydrogen, or coenzyme 1), in a process called glycolysis. It is the breaking down of glucose (glyco = glucose, lysis = break down).\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis in the absence of oxygen]]\nWhen glycolysis happens in the absense of oxygen, it is known as fermentation and it produces lactate. This is a stop gap measure for energy production when it is really needed quickly, like during exercise when muscles are pushed to their limit.\n\n### What is Krebs Cycle?\n\n\n### What is mitochondria and how do they work in the body?\n\n[[permanent/Mitochondria and their structure]]\nThey are structures believed to have descended from free-floating bacterium that our ancestors injected a long time ago. They do not share the same DNA make-up as humans, but instead they have their own DNA, and co-exist with humans to enable life as we know it.\n\nA mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which creates a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane to capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n\n[[permanent/Mechanism of generation of ATP by mitochondria]]\nWhen an electron is pulled into its internal chamber of the mitochondrion, a proton is expelled to the outer chamber. An electric field is built up between the inner and outer chamber. Each mitochondrion is like an electric battery waiting to discharge. The electric field strength is about 30 million V/m. Its like lightning in a bottle.\n\nThe proton is subject to an electric field and wants to get back into the inner chamber where the electric fields are. The only way through is to pass through small conduits shaped like mushrooms. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are like little turbines and the protons turn them as the pass through it. Each turn of the turbine assembles a molecule of Adenosine TriPhosphate, or ATP, which is the fundamental energy currency of the body. It is converted into kinetic, chemical or electrical energy by the body.\n\n\u003eMetabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n\n\\- James Somers\n\nAs you age, inflammation from a variety of causes such as disease, injury, diet, and stress causes mitochondrial wear and tear. Even just aging seems to cause mitochondria to wear, and that is not yet entirely understood. Old mitochondria are eaten by the body by a process called [[Mitophagy]], and new ones take its place. Aging slows down the replacement rate of mitochondria eventually.\n\n### The Warburg effect\n\n[[permanent/The Warburg Effect is a phenomenon where cancerous cells behave as if they are in a metabolic emergency]], like  during heavy exercise, where there is a shortage of oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis takes over in the cancer cells even when there is plenty of oxygen, and the cells start to ferment building up lactate. This happens universally among all cancers, and the presense of lactate is a common sign of a tumor's presence.\n\n### Link between mitochondrial, aging and cancer\n\nDue to mitochondrial wear and tear, waste products from the mitochondria start to pile up, and the body believes that this is due to a lack of oxygen. It then begins anerobic glycolysis and the cells start to ferment with the buildup of lactate. When glucose arrives, the cell does not strip away high frequency electrons as usual, but instead starts up the process for building more cells, which is one of its earliest directives during embryonic development. As a result, cancerous cells grow in the presence of fermenting cells and lactate, and is a possible explanation of the Warburg effect.\n\n----\n# References\n\n- [[read-it-later/How Food Powers Your Body]]\n- https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.061509547Z","tags":null},"/literature/A-Turning-music-into-a-chore-is-how-I-became-a-musician":{"title":"Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThe author of this article explains that by treating music making like a routine job that you do everyday, and putting in the time day after day without worrying about how good the output is, you can become really productive and consistent in making music, and produce high quality work.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Put in sheer time to get better at your craft, watch videos, learn how things are done.\n- Make music everyday, or on a repeatable set pattern. It's not something that depends on whether you feel like it or not.\n- Create a list of \"chores\" that is required to finish a piece of music. Do it everyday. Things to think about:\n\t- Steps to take a song from nothing to finish\n\t- Methods of music storage and retrieval for composition\n\t- Techniques to arrange the music into sections, how will you deal with bpm issues?\n\t- How will you control performance quality? Will you replay the tracks?\n\t- How will you remember how to play it? Will you figure it out again?\n\t- What is the plan for lyric writing (again something to practice everyday)? And how will you sing it? Pick a style that suits your voice- Like OSI.\n\t- What about the production phase, Mixing and Mastering?\n\t- Can you use AI-art (Stable diffusion) to generate album covers?\n\t- What is your method of distribution?\n- Never judge a piece of music when you just created it. File it away, you might love it later.\n- Make music boring. Get numb before you get good.\n\nThis follows the same principle that I've heard [[Misha Mansoor]] from [[Periphery]] talk about.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#cb6a981d-781e-4296-8b72-11189c3d6d28)\n\n\u003e German sociologist Georg Simmel rightly called metropolitan life an intensification of nervous stimulation. For the brain not to lose its marbles against this intensity, people must make rapid decisions with their heads instead of their hearts. As Simmel wrote beautifully in the paper Metropolis and Mental Life: \n‚ÄúThe reaction to metropolitan phenomena is shifted to that organ which is least sensitive and quite remote from the depth of the personality.‚Äù [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#d0ce5f0d-c2a9-4371-867f-2b13910acd57)\n\n\u003e There‚Äôs no heart in the metropolis, only a bunch of floating heads calculating their next moves. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#be88731d-b55f-4aef-8e3a-72bc7b53c983)\n\n\u003e A direct consequence of this metropolitan over-stimulation is something called the blas√© attitude. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#1cad3060-791d-4d52-9a01-c0b933e9f729)\n\n\u003e Simmel considered the blas√© attitude a byproduct of overstimulation from metropolitan life. A million things are happening in the city, and all the stimulations tend to ‚Äúagitate the nerves to their strongest reactivity for such a long time that they finally cease to react at all.‚Äù When we spend enough time in the city, we will reach a point where we‚Äôd stop caring about anything. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#1a3fe0f1-262c-422b-8140-844b37904d3c)\n\n\u003e And by trying our best to act deliberately against the chaotic currents, we may secure a patch of peace in our hyper-productive culture.

The enemy isn‚Äôt the rude city folks. Instead, it‚Äôs the undercurrent of our unsustainable pace that makes us so intolerable to one another.

To stick to the \"plan\", we need to have the willpower to overcome the resistance to follow the inflexible plan. Willpower is a quickly depleted resource, and it is best not to have to use it at all. By adopting zettelkasten, you can stay flexible, turn your attention to new insights and keep your interest, motivation and work aligned. This makes work effortless.\n\n[[fleeting/Dunning-Kruger Effect]]\n\n### Definition\nPeople with the least amount of knowledge tend to overestimate their competence level, and vice versa. They are faced with a [[dual burden]]: ignorance, and ignorance of their ignorance.\n\n### How does this affect us?\n- You lose opportunities to learn from people better than you\n- You fail to share your experise with others thinking you are not good enough aka, [[imposter syndrome]]\n- You feel disappointed when others do not recognize your talents, that you think you are excellent at\n- You fail to identify your true talents, results in poor life and career choices\n- Loudest voice in the room seems more effective than the experts opinion\n\n### How can we avoid this?\n- Be aware of the cognitive biases imposed by the Dunning Kruger syndrome and know that what you perceive may not be true\n- Compare yourself to others to get a more informed evaulation about your true strengths and weaknesses\n- Be open to criticism and feedback from others\n\n[[permanent/Value of an idea depends on its context]]\n\n## Chapter 2: Everything you need to do\n\n[[permanent/The importance of writing for learning, understanding, thinking and retention]]\n[[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]\n\n## Chapter 3: Everything you need to have\n\n\u003e[!Quote]The only thing necessary is to have an undistracted brain to think with, and a collection of notes which is the external scaffold for information storage\n\nOnly four tools are necessary:\n- Something to write stuff down on\n\t- A pen and pocket notebook is the best and simplest. You will write down thoughts that will be thrown away soon anyway after processing. Just capture your ideas.\n- Reference management system\n\t- Collect references and also notes you take during reading. Zotero is a highly recommended program with sufficient plugins\n- Slip-Box (Zettelkasten)\n\t- Use a digital note taking system to take your notes in. Obsidian seems to be the go-to here.\n- Text Editor\n\t- Zotero integration into the text editor is helpful. Obsidian already has that.\n\n## Chapter 4: Few things to keep in mind\n\n\u003e A tool is only as good as your ability to work with them.\n\\- Sonke Ahrens\n\nIt is important to understand what the slip-box system is, and how to use it, but also you should know *why* it works, so that you can tweak the tool to your needs.\n\n\n# Four underlying principles\n\n## Chapter 5: Writing is the only thing that matters\n\n\u003e An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.\n\nWriting is the only thing that counts in learning, research or studying. It *is* learning, research or study. Often in schools, writing is described as a separate activity done at the end of the research program. The typical sequence of learning/research is:  \"Brainstorm\" a research idea, read papers about it, do the necessary research, come to conclusions, and write a paper. But this is not true; writing helps during every stage of the research evolution.\n\n#### What are the advantages of writing while learning?\n- You will feel more engaged\n- You will learn to differentiate good ideas from one that only sound good\n- Your reading will be more engaged because you have to connect the note to ideas in your note collection by writing them in your own words\n- Much more likely to remember\n- You will do everything more deliberately\n\n## Chapter 6: Simplicity  is paramount\n\nThe old way of note taking is really what I been doing all my life- underline something in a book, write something in a margin, or write my thoughts on a sheet of paper to file away by topic. But this has never really worked. I forget where I put the note, how to get it back, and sometimes that I even wrote the note. There is no use in taking such notes in the first place. \n\nTake proper notes instead. So what is needed from this new system?\n\nA low threshold for taking notes, a process of elaborating your own thoughts on them in a day or two, and a way of storing such thoughts and interlinking them.\n\nOld system asks- Where do I store this note?\nNew system asks- In what context will I stumble on it again?\n\nOld system is a top down approach where you have to know where this \"belongs\" even before you developed insight. As your notes grow, it gets messier.\nNew system is a bottom up approach where your insights develop as the notes increases. It gets more orderly rather than messy.\n\nBut the slip box system can get messy too, if you add notes indiscriminately, without paying attention to their quality and the connections they make with your other notes. This is something to pay attention to.\n\nWhen it comes to taking notes, you must clearly distinguish between 3 kinds:\n1. Fleeting-  only to capture your notes, to be thrown away later.\n2. Permanent- well written notes in your own words that are never thrown away, but you will make connections to other such notes, and will eventually lead to insight. It has to be elabored on so that it will make sense on its own, without the context it was taken from.\n3. project- only needed when working on a project. Can be thrown away later. Examples of such notes are outlines, writing snippets, reminders, to-do lists, draft papers, etc.\n\n[[permanent/Common pitfalls in note taking methods]]:\n1. You treat every thought as though it were a permanent note. This dilutes the quality of actual good notes, and creates a mess.\n2. You take project specific notes. You decide what you want to write about, then work on collecting all the relevant info, and create notes for the project. This means that you have to start the process over for every project. Any other idea that is not relevant to the project will end up being discarded. This is a great loss to development of insight because at that moment you will not know what is important and what is not, and therefore discard valuable ideas.\n3. You treat every note as a fleeting note. You write ideas down on a scratch paper, and these pile up when you dont process them in any way, and soon you will forget their context and significance.\n\n## Chapter 7: Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch\n\nEvery academic writing book tells you that you should first decide what the topic you are going to work on is going to be, then collect and read all the relevant material, make notes (usually ends up as highlights and in the margins), and then write a report. \n\nThere are several downsides to this approach:\n1. You have picked the topic without knowing much about it at all\n\t1. No insight has been developed yet\n\t2. You might realize that this topic does not interest you. This results in being demotivated to work\n2. You face a blank screen or a blank paper when you are about to write\n3. You resort to *brainstorming* which is a very unreliable way to retrieve information from our brains that usually cannot store detailed information for very long\n\nThe main point here is that your writing starts long before you actually need to produce a report. You learn by writing, while you read a particular topic. You are always driven and motivated because you are following your interests and insight to see where it takes you, instead of working towards an ill-informed topic right from the start. When it is time to produce written material, it is simply a matter of arranging already written notes and filling in the gaps. \n\n## Chapter 8: Let the work carry you forward\n\nHaving ways of consistently and frequently receiving feedback on your work will provide a positive experience that will enable you to quickly get better at what you are learning. This quickly creates a positive spiral where we start to enjoy the work we do, work more and then get even better at the subject, and further enjoy our work! This way, the work carries you forward. This is no involvement of willpower or planning here. This related to [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]]. This concept should somehow apply to [[Music]] and instrument playing too. The better you get, the better you sound, and therefore more likely to play longer, ensuring a positive spiral.\n\nThe slip-box note taking system gives you the constant feedback you need to stay motivated by providing us with contradictions, connections and inconsistencies in relation to other notes in the slip box. This enables us to pursue further lines of thought to resolve these differences we see in the slip box. In addition, expressing writing in your own words really gives you feedback on whether you have fully understood the concept you are addressing. This will cement your learning much more reliably and enable you to get better even quicker.\n\n- [ ] Write about the growth Mindset\n\n\n# Six Steps to successful writing\n\n## Chapter 9: Separate and Interlocking tasks\n\n1. Each task should get undivided attention. No multitasking.\n2. Each writing task needs a different kind of attention (proof, critic, author, outlining). Everything requires a different perspective to get the job done. \n3. During reading, every kind of text needs a different kind of attention too.\n4. Do not follow prescribed or planning methods and strategies from other people to create your work; become an expert by spending time on it, making mistakes and developing experience that allows you to go by intuition.\n5. Break up the process of creation in smaller and more specific tasks and work on them to completion. Write down thoughts that arise along the way, and process them later. Our short term memory is limited.\n6. Have a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] that enables you to focus only on the creating aspect, and not on the workflow itself. You will be able to minimize [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]], and switch tasks easily without losing thoughts. \n\nIt is interesting that a lot of these steps are what is described in [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician]]\n\nAhrens goes into a quick tangent about creativity that is interesting. It has been found that the most creative minds in science or art have both kinds of attention: wide-open and playful, and narrow analytical frame. This *flexibility* is essential to creativity. I was just thinking how various kinds are attention are needed to compose a piece of music: think of the song structure is different from composing a solo.\n\n## Chapter 10: Read for Understanding\n\nAlways read with a pen in hand so that you can write down in your own words the meaning of the text you are reading. How detailed the literature notes are depends on the nature  of the text and how detailed it is. Sometimes you will need to write a lot of notes for a book, and sometimes you can simply write down a few sentences to summarize a book. The important thing is to write down permanent notes while finding ways in which the ideas from the book fit in your slipbox. You have to reflect on the book about what it tries to convey, what practices were used, what assumptions were made, etc. It is as much as what is *not* written that what *is* written. The read end-goal is to create permanent notes. Dont make taking literature notes a project in iteself.\n\nConfirmation bias is one of the biggest dangers in research where we seek out only what we agree with. Read with an open mind, and collect ideas indiscriminately in your slipbox whether you agree with them or not. You only purpose is to make connections to other permanent notes. This will help create new insight and avenues for thought, and will result in much better work that addresses pros and cons.\n\nPractice extracting the gist of the idea when you are reading. Express it in a concise and clear way, and be very selective. Thinking beyond the text and applying it in a different context is vital to clear understanding.\n\nThe process of creating notes tests your understanding of the text by explaining it to your future self. Re-reading a text only gives an illusion of understanding because of confirmation bias. Writing it down trying to teach your future self is the only way to understanding and learning. Test yourself.\n\nThe most successful method of learning is elaboration, which involves thinking, writing and connecting to other pieces of already known information. It may take time to do so, but without it reading a book is a waste of time because there is no learning for the long term.\n\n## Chapter 11: Take Smart Notes\n\nA reasonable measure of productivity in a day is the number of notes added to the slip box. \n\nIn 11.2, Ahrens gives an example of how he read a book, and then developed personal notes out of it. It is good for the reader to have a clear example of how this slip box system works. In my opinion, this should have been presented much earlier in the book instead of waiting for Chapter  11!\n\nThere are two steps to elaboration: \n1. Think deeply enough about what you are reading\n2. Think about the meaning in other contexts than the text\n\nMake sure your note can be found later, by including them in an index or making sure it can connect form an index.\nBuild a \"Latticework of Mental Models\"\n\n## Chapter 12: Develop Ideas\n\nDont worry about gaps in the notes as it relates to concepts. If it helps you think better, write down the gaps in the thought process as a note as well. Most gaps in the argument will only become clear when you take out notes from the slip box to create a draft\n\nDont link too many notes from an index, just one or two. The interlinks between notes are much more important because being surprised by connections between notes is important later on.\n\nIf you want to write an article from a bunch of notes, create a new note with links to them. This can be temporary and subject to change as the topic develops. If the topic deviates significantly from your initial conception of the article, you can even create another note different from the first one.\n\nWhen creating notes, think of what keywords you might assign to it. Just one or two that puts it in a context different from where you got the note from. This is not the same as creating tags (that is more for note sorting in Obsidian). Look for unlinked mentions in Obsidian for possible suggestions to where you can link to other contexts. \n\nIf a topic has accumulated a significant number of notes on a topic, you might need a note that forms an index with links to about 25 notes with short descriptions of each. You will know when you need such a note. This note can then be linked to from the main index.\n\nAdding ideas to slip box leads to refinements, contradictions and corrections to old ideas, and overcomes the feature-positive effect, where we give more importance to more recent information even if its not the most relevant. Slip box enables us to access long forgotten ideas.\n\n\u003e You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head\n\u003e \\-Charlie Munger\n\nA slip box is a space where ideas can mingle freely so that you can come up with new ones.\n\nThe key to creative problem solving is the abstraction of ideas into more general context. This is something that a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] should support.\n\nOur brain is wired to jump to conclusions on what we are reading. Only upon revisiting, rethinking and revising our notes on the text can we truly understand or interpret in a different way. This is being \"open-minded\" with ourselves, knowing that our own interpretation can change.\n\nCreativity can have its roots from simple ideas pieced together to form something complex. This reminds me of a multilevel perceptron in machine learning.\n\nRestriction and structure are an essential crucible in which creativity is forged.\n\n## Chapter 13: Share your insight\n\nWriting with a zettelkasten system is simple:\n1. Look at your notes and see where the keywords cluster. That determines your topic.\n2. Gather all relevent notes and piece together an outline\n3. Identify missing arguments and work on filling them\n4. Forget about the slip box and narrow focus on getting the writing done\n5. Work on mutiple writing projects concurrantly, switching between them as often as you like\n6. Never fear to cut text from your drafts, and re-write as many times as needed.\n\nBeing intimately famiiliar with the slip box system enables you to internalize the ideas in it through elaboration. Your mind becomes more open and receptive to new lines of thought, fostering creative work.\n\n\n## Chapter 14: Make it a habit\n\nMake it a habit to read with a pen and paper in hand.\n\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.

This book is about facing our finitude and making choices to pick and choose activities that give us most happiness and satisfaction in our limited time. Reader should be aware that this book often dabbles in existential nihilism hinting that our life is so short that it is basically devoid of meaning. Instead, the takeaway really here is that time is our most valuable resource and we should treat it as such.\n\n## Who should read this book?\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed with the number of things piling up in your to-do list, fueled by your commitment to work, family and hobbies that you derive satisfaction, this book gives some perspectives on how we can pick and choose things that we will get most happiness from. If you have trouble saying no, this book will help you identify that making hard choices is required to make use of our finite time. I would assume that this book is directed at at-least 30 somethings who have reached a point in their career and family where the number of obligations is too much to meet. \n\n## Tools to embrace our finitude\n\n- Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity\n\t- Use dual to-do list approach:\n\t\t- A \"current\" one limited to 10 entries. Only by finishing tasks, can you make way for more.\n\t\t- An \"open\" one that you put all your tasks into, knowing full well that some of them may never be finished.\n\t- Another apporach is to use a fixed time approach to establish the boundaries of daily work.\n- Serialize\n\t- Only focus on a big project at a time and see it to completion before moving on to the next.\n- Decide in advance what to fail at\n\t- There are great benefits to strategic underachievement. You can identify beforehard what you intend to do poorly at, and that will make way for you to succeed in the important things. You can also take a cyclical approach to failing, where you decide that you will not do something or do it poorly for the next few months.\n- Make a Completed list\n\t- Instead of always looking to a to-do list, start a completed list and only list tasks you have completed on it. This will avoid the anxiety of seeing all the tasks yet to be finished and derive satisfaction from your successes.\n- Consolidate your caring\n\t- If you are donating time to charity, political causes or activism, make sure you limit yourself to a few tasks.\n- Embrace single purpose technology\n\t- Pen and paper is often effective for note taking\n\t- When not reading physical books, kindle has minimal distractions compared to iPads\n- Seek out novelty in the mundane\n\t- Enjoy what you are doing instead of seeking out new pleasures. Absorb the now, and you will fill out time a lot longer. Go on walks, play with a child, meditate. Draw attention to the present.\n- Become a better listener\n\t- Relationships will be strengthened if you pay more attention to the other person speaking. Ask questions and adopt a mentality of curiousity, and show that you genuinely care about others.\n- Become spontaneous\n\t- If you think of calling a friend, do it right away. If you want to donate money, dont put it off until too much later.\n- Practice doing nothing\n\t- Just doing nothing enables you to feel the sensations and time flowing around you. Be present in it and stop trying to constantly manipulate your present experience.\n\n## Chapter Notes\n### Introduction: In the long run, we're all dead\n\n* We have 4000 weeks to live. Thats very short in the grand scheme of things. This book is about facing that fact, and accepting that we will never get everything done\n* Productivity has become: how do we cram most number of tasks into as little time as possible\n* We all regret \"wasting\" time when we are either too busy (no time to do what I want) or when having too much time (what should i have really been doing with my time?), because we are aware that time is limited.\n* Contrast life to a conveyor belt:\n\t* Tasks keep coming and we are supposed to get it done\n\t* We use productivity tools and shave time off each task\n\t* This causes conveyor below to move faster -\u003e more tasks\n- John Maynard Keene predicted that we will have 15 hour work weeks soon. He was wrong. We work more than ever now\n- Busyness has become a symbol of prestige, which is strange because the goal of getting rich is to not work as hard.\n* We yearn to spend time in more meaningful ways:\n\t* desire to devote to larger cause\n\t* having day job to cover what you really want to do\n\n### 1: The limit embracing life\n\n- We need new ideas about how to think about the limited time we have and how we use it.\n- Each hour of life is a container on the conveyor belt of life that we feel we have to fill with something\n- Before timetables were existed, people were mostly task-oriented. Do the task when it is necessary, no scheduling\n- This gives rise to a sense of timelessness that Richard Rohr calls living in deep time. We get this sensation when we see big landscapes where we lose ourselves for a moment.\n- We have started treating time as a resource, and feel like we dont have enough or wasting too much. Trying to make better use of time, we push ourselves harder even when there is no need to. It never feels like you do well enough.\n- Accept reality: time is short, you will never do all you want. Be guided by the time it inherently takes to do something, called *Eigenzeit* in German. Resist the need to do everything, and let time be your guide.\n\n### 2: The Efficiency Trap\n\n- What is it?\n\t\t- We believe we can get more efficient at doing our tasks and then \"make time\" for the things that really matter.\n\t- Parkinson's law will ensure that work always baloons to fill the time available.\n\t- Hard choices should be made: you have to give up something to make time for something else.\n\t- Instead of getting things done, you will add more things to do\n- You will not get it all done; just focus on the ones that count\n- Existential overwhelm: You want the get all of life experiences and push yourself to do so. Life has infinite experiences to offer, you can't have all of them. Enjoy the tiny slices of experiences you actually do have\n- If the goal is to clear your to-do list, you will end up doing the meaningless small tasks first instead of the important ones. So accept the fact that your to-do list will always have things on it, just prioritize better on the important things\n- By using convenience tools to eradicate life's seemingly tedious tasks, you often remove meaning and connection from your life.\n\n### 3: Facing Finitude\n\n- The early part of this chapter focuses on the fact that life will ultimately end; momento mori- remember that you will die. This might serve as a reminder to people who live very fast paced lives without stopping to think.\n- It usually happens that you face a moment of clarity when faced with finitude, like death or a terminal illness. We should not wait until that moment to realize that time is our most valuable asset.\n\n### 4: Become a better procrastinator\n- learn to neglect the right things, or the *art of creative neglect*.\n\t- Pay yourself first when it comes to time.\n\t\t- Use your primetime hours to do what is most important to you\n\t\t- If you are waiting to start a creative project, a social cause or anything that matters to you, at a later date, \"when you have the time\", dont. Start today, however small.\n\t\t- Protect time by scheduling meetings with yourself\n\t- Limit your number of concurrent projects\n\t\t- Do not work on more than 3 concurrent projects at once. If you need to add more, remove one from the list first.\n\t\t- Feel free to abandon a project if it isnt working out\n\t\t- Limit the number of half-finished projects\n\t\t- Define your projects in managable chunks, and work on actively finishing them. Something like \"get better at music\" is too broad. Pick a song you want to learn. This would avoid the project from clogging up the system when something more interesting comes along\n\t- Learn to say no to projects you *do* want to do\n\t\t- There will be many projects that you will want to do\n\t\t- Learn to actively say no to them. This is the way to focus on your priorities\n- We fear committing to a single path in projects or relationships. We have the fear of missing out on possibilities that could have been. We live out a perfect fantasy in our heads, and escape when reality does not meet that perfect expectation. A fine example is Franz Kafka's relationship with his fiance Felice Bauer.\n- You must settle on something, in order to strive to get better at it. You have to commit to an instrument you want to play, for example. Switching all the time will scatter your efforts needlessly.\n- I disagree with Burkeman that one should have a child to \"settle\" and find happiness. Yes, children are great, but its a responsibiliy that not all are cut out or want to begin with.\n- Once you make a choice to settle on something, anxiety falls away and now you can move forward with purpose\n\n### 5: The watermelon problem\n- People spent 40 mins watching a TV show where people were putting rubber bands on a watermelon till it burst. This seeming utter waste of time, seems a much better source of entertainment than how we spend our time \"doomscrolling\" on social media.\n- What you apply your attention to, is what dictates how you spend your life energy. Social media is a machine designed to collect your attention reserves for profit, and most people give away too much of their attention (life energy) to social media without realizing it. \n\n### 6: The intimate interruptor\n- Why do we so readily get distracted from hard tasks (like our job, or reading, or pracitisng an instrument)? We are the ones that distract ourselves ultimately.  Burkeman suggests that this is because of our awareness of finitude.\n\t- I disagree with this dramatic explanation of a fact that is much better explained with how social media is designed to deliver instant dopamine hits which the mind starts to crave. Most tasks worth doing do not give instant gratificaation. Finitude has nothing to do with it. It's a weak explanation attempting to shoehorn this observation into the theme of this book.\n- Burkeman suggests that there is nothing we can do to avoid distracting ourselves all the time. That aall techniques such as focus music, meditation, etc are pointless.\n\t- I disagree with this because it has been shown that binaural beats increase focus, and meditation has far reaching impacts on the body and mind even if done only for 17 minutes a day (heard from Huberman lab podcast). Again, the author paints a hopeless picture that we are supposed to accept.\n- We distract ourselves from our work, because we know what we can achieve is finite and limited. We can build in our imagination a perfect world, but reality usually falls short and we avoid facing this reality.\n\n### 7: We never really have time\n- Douglas Hofstadter jokingly said- Any task will take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law. For example, the sydney opera house took 14 years instead of the planned 4 years.\n- In trying to plan everything ahead of time to perfection, so that you will be able to avoid an outcome you do not want, you often cause more anxiety to yourself instead of facing the actual consequencies would cause themselves.\n- We strive to control our time and refuse to accept our limitations. By trying to shape our future by controlling time today, which leads to anxiety. A simple cure to this anxiety is to realize that we will never be able to fully ensure our future outcomes\n- Uncertainity has brought us this far in life. We handled it once, and will surely handle it in the future. Learn to accept future outcomes even if it is not the ideal one you imagined.\n\n### 8: You are here\n- *Instrumentalizing time*: Using time as a means to achieve something in the future. This is a problem we all face.\n- Abandon the future-chasing mentality of \"when-i-finally\" to do something. There is no fixed task list that you can complete that will result in an overnight state of happiness.\n- Children are a great example of being in the present. Their purpose is to be a child. They dont worry about kindergarden, grade school, high school, college, etc. This kind of future chasing mentality comes from the parent.\n- Life is just a series of moments that you have to experience now. Being absent in the present and working towards a future benefit means that you will miss life itself.\n\n### 9: Rediscovering Rest\n\n- We have even taking the pleasure out of leisure by:\n\t- Pressurizing ourselves to extract the most out of our holiday time\n\t- Use our time off to get things done and be \"productive\"\n\t- Using leisure as a means to be more productive later\n- True leisure according to Aristotle is self-reflection and philisophical contemplation, and is the highest of virtues.\n- Medival peasants worked only for 150 days a year, but the industrial age meant that workers need to be in factories, and were allowed to do what they pleased with their time off as long as it didnt interrupt profits.\n- Todays concept of rest is only a means to recuperate from work, and be more productive when going back to it, or to improve ourselves for a future benefit. Anything that does not fit into this framework is viewed as wasteful.\n- To truly enjoy rest, you have to accept that this is it, and that you cannot work yourself towards a state of perfect happiness. Real rest, where we do nothing can feel uncomfortable at first, but that is a sign that you are doing it right.\n- It is worth undertaking 'atelic' activities, what are things you do for the sake of doing them alone, like hiking.\n\n### 10: The Impatience Spiral\n\n- We suffer from chronic impatience, where we honk at others for no reason, don't wait for the microwave timer to run out, inch towards cars at red lights, etc.\n- Technology has made things fast for us, but we still strive to go faster. Food reheats in a minute, but we would rather it took zero seconds. This impatience has led us to experience \"restlessness\" when we pick up a book to read, because reading is something that cannot be rushed. We are constantly submitting to interruptions, and using it as an excuse to avoid the discomfort that comes with something that takes time.\n- Working faster has become an addiction, where we believe that we need to work as hard and as fast as possible to survive, leading to anxiety, which only makes us work more. This phenomenon is celebrated society as being \"driven\"\n- Surrender to the reality that things will take the time they take. Reframe your perspective to relish the hard things in life that take time.\n\n### 11: Stay on the Bus\n\n- To be successful at the hard things, \"stay on the bus\". Stick with it longer than others can and will, while having the patience to face failure and imperfection and you will be successful after sufficient effort has been put into your endeavor.\n- Not being in control results in discomfort and we shy away from situations where patience and acceptance of the lack of control would be the better choice. Example, fixing an unknown problem, listening to your partner carefully, working on a difficult creative problem.\n- Three principles of patience:\n\t- Develop a taste for having problems. Learn to love them.\n\t- Embrace radical incrementalism. Be consistent in getting a little better everyday. The results will be staggering. Don't be impatient for dramatic results.\n\t\t- If you've dedicated a small time slot for consistently chipping away on a project, walk away when that time slot is done even if you're in the flow. The ability to do this everyday is more important that doing a lot in one day. Stopping helps develop the patience muscle to keep getting after it day after day.\n\t- Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality. Your initial work will always be unoriginal, but you have to \"stay on the bus\" long enough till true originality starts to emerge.\n\n### 12: The Loneliness of the Digital Nomad\n\n- Time is not useful if you are forced to experience it all on your own. It is a \"networked good\", whose value is higher when other people's time is shared and co-ordinated with yours (like a phone; it's no use having it all to yourself)\n- In the post-covid world, there is an increasing number of people who work from anywhere in the work, aka, the digital nomad. But people found that without a sense of community, it gets increasingly lonely.\n- In USSR, Stalin's chief economist, Yuri Larin,  suggested having a staggered day off in the week, so that the factories can run all week, and increase productivity. The result was the people were unhappy because their inner circle never had time off at the same time. Time off only makes sense if it is synced with others you want to spend your time with.\n- This is why Sweden's, *fika* works so well. In a fika, the entire workplace gathers at the same time in the day for coffee and cake, and they even get offended if people don't show up at a fika. You dont control your time off in this case, but it makes it very meaningful to connect with others.\n- Burkeman talks about keeping in sync during drills, in a choir, or in communal prayers where time feels more *vivid*, when it is filled with more meaning.\n- We need to draw a balance between individual and communal time to extract most meaning out of life. Too much of either can be detrimental to overall happiness.\n\n### 13: Cosmic Insignificance Theory\n\n-  In the time scale of the cosmos, our finite lives are truly insignificant, and the universe could not care less about what we do with our time.\n- Burkeman says that the whole of human civilization is about sixty lifetimes, and goes on to conclude that our own lifetime is nothing but a meaningless flicker.\n\t- This absolutely makes no sense. If all of human civilization is *only* sixty lifetimes, then each of our lives is absolutely meaningful, and what we do with our time can affect the course of human civilization, no matter in how miniscule a way.\n\t- He says if we realized how insignificant we are, we would not even be motivated to propagate our genes. Another absurd claim.\n- What does make sense is to not hold ourselves to a unrealisitic standard of what can be considered a significnat life well spent.\n\n### 14: The Human Disease\n\nBurkeman poses five questions that we can answer for ourselves to assess the reality of our finite-time situation:\n\n1. *‚ÄúWhere in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what‚Äôs called for is a little discomfort?‚Äù*  -- you want to make sure you're making choices that result in personal growth.\n2. *‚ÄúAre you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?‚Äù* -- be realisitic in what you can do.\n3. *‚ÄúIn what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?‚Äù* -- don't prove yourself to anyone, or meet expectations set by others, instead accept who you are and what you can achieve.\n4. *‚ÄúIn which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù* -- you may never reach mastery on a skill you're working on, so get started with what you have right now and do what you will with it.\n5. *‚ÄúHow would you spend your days differently if you didn‚Äôt care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?‚Äù* -- avoid being driven by results to achieve satisfaction; the journey is just as important.\n\n\n\n### Quotes\n\n\u003e‚ÄúWe labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life,‚Äù wrote Nietzsche, ‚Äúbecause to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe treat everything we‚Äôre doing‚Äîlife itself, in other words‚Äîas valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else.‚Äù -- in the context of instrumentalizing time.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúOur obsession with extracting the greatest future value out of our time blinds us to the reality that, in fact, the moment of truth is always now‚Äîthat life is nothing but a succession of present moments, culminating in death, and that you‚Äôll probably never get to a point where you feel you have things in perfect working order. And that therefore you had better stop postponing the ‚Äúreal meaning‚Äù of your existence into the future, and throw yourself into life now.‚Äù\n\n\u003e‚ÄúIn order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth‚Äù\n\n---\n### References\n\nOliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021, 1st Ed.","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.061509547Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Forte-2022":{"title":"B-Forte-2022","content":"\n![BookCover|300](https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/07/30/original/Shelf_Help_Building_a_Second_Brain_1659188011198.jpg)\n\n## What is a second brain and how does it work?\n\nIn today's digital world we are inundated with information in the form of books, articles, podcasts, tweets and so on. If we do not have a way to capture and store snippets of information from this constant barrage of knowledge, there is no way for our brains to recall important snippets of information when it is needed.\n\nEnter \"the [[second brain]]\", a digital [[commonplace book]], where we capture information and organize it in a meaningful way that enables easy retrieval later. It is a form of [[personal knowledge management]] where we build up a repository of knowledge that is relavant to our interests and pull from it for the rest of our lives.  \n\nIn the professional world, [[notetaking]] involves creating notes while viewing them as a knowledge building block. Collect enough of them and reconstruct it in your own way to create something beautiful or important. The length and format of a note does not matter, as long as it is interpreted through your own lens, curated by your tastes, and drawn from your personal experience (this is in direct contrast to [[zettelkasten]] where notes should be as succint as possible [[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow|zettelkasten workflow]], [[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work|writing with zettelkasten]]; Forte does bring up the reduction of a note to it's essence later however).\n\nUsing a second brain system has the following benefits:\n- It helps us declutter out minds by putting thoughts down as notes\n- Reveals new associations between ideas (it's not entirely clear how though, as we will see later; in zettelkasten, the links between notes exist to make clear connections)\n- Incubate our ideas over time (we tend to choose our most recent ideas and run with it - [[recency bias]]; using old notes might help us discover older but still good ideas)\n- Sharpen our perspectives ([[personal knowledge management]] systems gives us a trove of supporting material we can pull from to make a point on any topic)\n\n## The CODE Framework\n\n[[Tiago Forte]] proposes the Capture, Organize, Distill, Express (CODE) framework to implement the second brain system.\n\n- ==Capture==: Whenever something \"resonates\" with you, capture it in your notetaking system. It is not an analytical decision - identify things that incite, curiousity, pleasure, wonder, or excitement.\n- ==Organize==: Save notes by **actionability**, based on your current projects.\n- ==Distill==: Reduce the idea to it's key concept, in it's most concise form.\n- ==Express==: Use all your capture to create something new.\n\n### CAPTURE\n\nMany highly creative people have a creative process that they rely on. [[Taylor Swift]] writes down snippets of lyrics or music that comes into her mind at random times, and then relies on that to build up her music writing process. [[Jerry Seinfeld]] wrote down all ideas for jokes in a yellow legal pad and filed it away in an accordian folder, and used that to write all his material. The key here lies in capturing what comes across your way so that it can be transformed into somthing useful later.\n\nOne pitfall in the capture process is saving too much information. There needs to be some criteria for how to choose what needs to be captured. Broadly, it should have at least some of the following elements: Inspiring, Useful, Personal, Surprising. The recommendation is to ultimately capture what \"resonates\" - as loose as this term may be. In all cases, *the source of the note* should be captured.\n\n### ORGANIZE - THE PARA FRAMEWORK\n\nThe framework to organize notes is based on actionability - \"In which project will this be most useful?\" - and is based on the PARA System; **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, **Archives**.\n\n- Projects -  These are current projects you are working on, which could include work, personal or side projects. You could put notes related to each project directly into its associated project folder.\n- Areas - These are broader \"areas\" in your life that are not tied to a particular project. They could be things like Health, Finance, Writing, Music, etc. Notes that fall into these areas of interest area stored in its own location, and can be easily pulled from later.\n- Resources - These are topics you are interested in, and generally serve no immediate purpose other than your broad interest in them. They serve as a source for research material later on, if you happen to convert these areas of interest into projects.  Some examples are - Notetaking, Nutrition, Music Recording, Habit formation, etc.\n- Archives - All things no longer relevant from the previous three areas go here. Projects that are done or abandoned, areas that are no longer relevant, or resources you are no longer interested in.\n\nWhenever you capture a note, ask yourself which of these areas it belongs to, and categorize it appropriately. Notes do not permanently live in any category, they are constantly moving and rearranging depending on how your interests and priorities progress.\n\n### DISTILL\n\nWhen you are creating notes for your future self, it is important to find ways to convey the idea from any given note in its most succint form to your future self who will likely not have the time to review the note in its original captured form. This is where the need to distill comes in.\n\nThe method used to distill a note into its essence is called [[Progressive Summarization]]. You pick up any particular note and create highlights of the important parts, and you can do this at several levels:\n- Level 1 - Highlight all the important aspects of the note, so that you can tell the essence of the note by just reading the highlights.\n- Level 2 - Bold (or use another highlighter color) to highlight your earlier highlights so that just a few sentences can tell you what the note is about.\n- Level 3 - At the top of the note, write an executive summary of the note in your own words that you can quickly read to understand the gist of it. This level is probably not needed for all notes.\n\nTo be effective, it is important to \"take-away\" from the note and only leave in what captures the absolute essence of the note.\n\nPitfalls in the highlighting process:\n- Over highlighting - marking up too much of the original note makes it useless to your future self because you are going to have to re-read all of that again.\n- Highlighting without a purpose - you should only be doing the highlighting on a particular note when you have the intention to actually use it for something. You don't have to highlight every note you capture.\n- Making highlighting difficult - highlighting should be an easy process while relying on the feeling of \"resonance\", and not an overly analytical activity.\n\nThe key point here is that *every time you touch a note, you leave it a bit more discoverable for your future self*.\n\n### EXPRESS\n\nThis is the final stage of the [[notetaking]] process that you have been working towards. All of those notes mean nothing if you do not create something with them. Notes are not meant to be collected, but used to create something new and different.\n\nBreak down the work that is to be done into smaller sized [[intermediate packets]].  They are individual concrete blocks that make up your work. There are 5 kinds of intermediate packets that you can use in your work.\n- Distilled notes - Books or notes you have read, that are broken down to its essence using the [[progressive summarization]] technique\n- Outtakes - ideas that didnt make it in a previous project\n- Work in process - documents created during past projects\n- Final deliverables - Completed projects that can kick off something new\n- Documents created by others -  work created by others that you can use as a starting point for your own work\n\nThe main idea here is no matter what form of material you use as a starting point, you should use that as a template for your own work, while giving credit where it is due. So, always look around you for work that you have already done, or work others did that you can use as a template. \n\nThis is a powerful idea that is very applicablle in the workplace and in creative endeavors. Did an employee use a really nice  format of representing data? Ask him/her if it is okay if you reuse their method. Did you hear a good beat or riff? Use that as a starting point, and play with the tune adding your own flavor to it. \n\nThere are several advantages to using intermediate packets:\n- You are working on a small chunk of work at a time. You are less prone to interruptions, and will likely get that chunk of work done.\n- You will be ready to work at a moments notice because you know you can finish off a small chunk of work, instead of waiting for a time when you can fully concentrate.\n- You can collect feedback on smaller chunks of work, instead of going through with the whole thing and finding out it does not meet requirements.\n- You will have many such chunks collected over time that you can easily reuse them in future work.\n\nWhen you break up a project into intermediate packets, ask yourself: \"How do I assemble each of these components without having to make them myself?\"\n\nHere is where I believe this entire book falls apart - the retrieval methods. Very little time is spent on how exactly notes can be retrieved while making connections that did not exist before. Here is what the books suggests as ways to extract notes and insight out of the system:\n- Search - Just blatant keyword searches in the notes app might show you what you are looking for\n- Browsing - You manually browse through the PARA folder structure looking for stuff you need\n- Tags - tagging notes allows you to traverse past rigid folder hierarchies, but as we all know, the method of tagging breaks down when you have too many tags or cant remember them\n- Serendipity - Randomly look around PARA folders to see if something else in there interests you (this is very random, how will you even know where to look? what if there is valuable insight but you just didnt look at it?)\n\nThe main content of this part is that *everything is a remix*. Use your notes system to hash out something with your own personal flavor.","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.061509547Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Meyer-1976-Ch4":{"title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits","content":"![meyer](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KleHb8JHL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n- Bias circuits designed with current sources tend to be more insensitive to power-supply and temperature variations\n- For small currents, they tend to have a smaller on-chip footprint compared to resistor based techniques\n- As active loads, they provide high impedance, enabling high gain in voltage amplifiers\n\n\n\n## 4.2 Simple Current Source\n\n### ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\n\nTransistor Q1 is diode-connected which means that the collector-base voltage is zero.

He attributes their success to what he defines as **Deep Work**, which is defined as:\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúProfessional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.‚Äù\n\nHere are some examples of people who have had a tendency to go into deep focus modes when doing their work:\n1. Carl Jung, built a house for himself where he could isolate himself for work\n2. Mark Twain wrote in a shed away from the family, who had to blow a horn to alert him for meals\n3. Peter Higgs, physicist, was so isolated that people could not find him to tell him he had won the nobel prize\n4. Bill Gates stayed in his lakeside cottage for two \"Think Weeks\" in a year, from where he wrote the famous \"Internet Tidal Wave\" memo\n\nBut we live in a time where distraction is celebrated by being instantly responsive on communication platforms, and in contrast most knowledge workers perform **Shallow Work**, defined as,\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúNoncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.‚Äù\n\nIt appears that the modern world is permanently erasing our ability to perform Deep Work. Instead of nostalgically looking at our distraction-free past, deep work today has more meaning than ever before for two reasons:\n1. It is valuable to quickly learn complicated things\n2. In the digital age, creating valuable work has incredible reach- more than ever before\nIn the internet age, more and more people are becoming knowledge workers, and those who have the ability to do deep work, will stand out above the others. This is called the **Deep Work Hypothesis**.\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.‚Äù\n\nIt is notable that deep work does not mean long hours. It is a period of intense focus every for 3-4 hours a day, that is capable of producing valuable output. A deep life is a good life, as Newport says.\n\n### Deep Work is Valuable\n\nIn this section, three \"successful\" people are provided as examples, and the reason for their success is considered. Our future economy looks increasingly *divided* where easy to replicate jobs will be automated away, and hard to replicate jobs will become more valuable. Let's see who these people are and what makes them valuable.\n1. Nate Silver- a statistician who took his love of baseball to election predictions\n\t1. ==A highly skilled worker==, who is capable of taking data and manipulating it with machines to successfully predict new outcomes\n2. David Hansson- a programmer who created Ruby on Rails, used a lot to build the internet\n\t1. ==A superstar whose skillset is clearly at a premium==, and it often makes more economic sense to hire a superstar to get the job done instead of hiring a team of mediocre programmers not capable of that kind of output\n\t2. Everybody's skill today is traded on a \"universal bazaar\" where the best will clearly dictate a premium over all others\n3. John Doerr- a venture capitalist who fueled many major and successful tech companies\n\t1. ==A wealthy individual with lots of investable capital==, can fund a company like Instagram which sold for a billion dollars with only 13 people\n\nNot everyone has capital to invest, but the first two are definitely worth looking at. Our interest essentially lies in how we develop the ability to:\n1. quickly master hard things\n2. produce at an elite level (quality and speed)\n\nThe contrary is also important to consider and Newport states:\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt produce, you won‚Äôt thrive‚Äîno matter how skilled or talented you are.‚Äù\n\nBoth of these skills essentially depends on our ability to do deep work.\n\nTo develop the ability to master hard things, we need to have\n1. Intense concentration where all our attention is solely focused on overcoming the challenge ahead of us, without distraction\n2. Deliberate practice to fail multiple times, use the feedback from the experience and correct your methods till you achieve success\n3. Neurological scaffolding called Myelin, which is a fatty tissue that develops around neurons when they are being used to do challenging tasks. Repeated work triggers oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around neurons\n\nNewport uses the example of Adam Grant, the youngest tenured prof at Wharton, who produced an absurdly high number of papers and a best selling book Give and Take. He takes the fall semester to do all his teaching and then all this research is batched into spring and summer. He also uses smaller batches to time to work deep, by putting out-of-office notices when he is working on a paper.\n\nThe reason you need long stretches of time to do deep work is due to attention residue. When you switch from one task to another, there is a residue left over from the previous task. This is entirely antithetical to the idea of multi-tasking where the semi-distracted state never lets you ultimately focus.\n\nWhat about Jack Dorsey? The twitter ex-CEO famously spends time in meetings and conversations with people doing what we define here as shallow work. He is still an effective leader and has proven he can disrupt the industry. Why? Deep work is not always applicable to all kinds of people in all roles. But in most circumstances deep work is usually valuable. There are always exceptions to the rule.\n\n### Deep work is rare\n\nToday's work culture is chock full of terms that are meant to keep people and ideas \"connected\" together; open workpaces, instant messaging, social media. Many organizations *require* their employees to respond instantly to emails and messages, and even to develop a social media presence, while not prioritizing deep work as a fundamental component of achieving productivity in a workplace.\n\nThe reason the companies do not see that the always-connected trend is detrimental to their business is due to the **metric black hole**, which is another way of saying that it is difficult to put a monetary value on the impact on the business causes by these office distractions which keep people away from deep work.\n\nWhat are some of the mental models that cause people to embrace distractions instead of deep work?\n- Principle of least resistance\n\t- Getting an answer to your question immediately makes your work easier, at least for the time being\n\t- People appear to be working when sending/receiving emails even if they have nothing else to show for work. Companies seem to permit working out of an email inbox.\n\t- Setting weekly meetings on the pretext of following up on projects is a proxy for staying on track with your own work, even if others have nothing to contribute in your meeting.\n- Busyness as a proxy for productivity\n\t- Knowledge work lacks real metrics to show that you have been productive\n\t- Being visibly busy is a viable option to prove to management that you are productive (even if you have nothing to show for it)\n- The cult of the internet\n\t- We have come to accept the \"internet\" as being good for us, often without considering the ramifications entirely.\n\t- This technopoly assumes that everyone should and will adopt the latest in technology because it is \"good\" for them (why won't you have a cell phone? do you know how convienient it is?)\n\nWith distractions from social media and the culture of connectivity in workplaces, deep work is becoming increasing rare, which is really bad for businesses. However, if everyone is always in a distracted state, those who are capable of deep work will suddenly find themselves in a fortunate position when they can produce at an elite level.\n\n### Deep work is meaningful\n\nEverything is not always about being successful and wealthy. Deep work is capable making a life meaningful and well worth living. The following arguments will prove that it is so, in a neurological, psychological and philosophical sense.\n\n**Neurological**: Science writer, Winifred Gallagher, in her book Rapt, says that our quality of life depends on what we pay attention to and what we ignore. Most often, we look at it backwards, ie, what happens to us should dictate how we feel. (There are some fMRI experiement arguments trying to support the neurological origin for this argument that does not make much sense.)\n\nDeep work allows your attention to focus on what is important, and ignore the minute stresses that are present in shallow work such as emails and instant messages. As such this results in an improved quality of life, because the small stuff does not stress us out throughout the day. A meaningful connection with your work can be very fulfilling.\n\n**Psychological**: When humans are deeply immersed in a challeging activity, they engage the limits of the mental powers while achieving what Csikszentmihalyi calls a *flow state* during which time takes on a different meaning, and a deep sense of satisfaction and happiness emerges.\n\n**Philosophical**: Sacredness has always been connected to meaning in the course of human culture, but since the evolution of Descartes' skepticism which put an individual over the importance of an all-knowing god, has led us to a life devoid of meaning. However, by dedicating ourselves to our craft, we can once again spark that connection to the sacredness and meaning.  Cultivating craftsmanship is a deep task that requires a commitment to deep work. It can be argued that our daily job is much too mundane to be sacred. This is because we have been led to believe that rarified jobs (nonprofits, startups, unique roles) are the only ones with meaning. Newport refutes this with\n\u003e[!quote] You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work\n\n### Rule 1: Work Deeply\n\nDavid Dewane envisions what he calls *The Eudaimonia Machine* which is an architectural concept for a workspace whose sole purpose is to enable deep work. The structure is a one-storey narrow rectangle with five rooms placed in a line, but there are no shared hallways. You need to pass through each room to get to the next one. The five rooms are\n1. *The Gallery*: contains examples of deep work produced in the building, to create a healthy mix of stress and peer pressure\n2. *The Salon*: a place to create intense curiousity and arguments that you will later develop deeper in the machine\n3. *The Library*: has records of all work produced in the machine, and has copies and scanners that you can use to collect material for your own deep work\n4. *The Office*: place to complete all the shallow work needed for your projects, email notes, webpage clippings, note collections.\n5. *The Chamber*: room with sound proof wall for total focus. The intention is to spend 90 minutes at a time and take a 90 minute break, and repeat this a few times a day will the brain has reached it's capacity for deep work.\n\nWe need to somehow emulate this process in our daily lives so that we can slip into deep work modes. We always have the urge to turn to something superficial, and this is the biggest obstacle to deep work. Roy Baumeister established that *willpower* is a finite resource that gets depleted as you use it. The key is to *not* rely on willpower to do deep work but instead develop a work habit that adds routines and rituals to put you in a state of intense concentration.\n\n==**Decide on your depth philosophy**==\n\nYou *must* decide on a depth philosophy that best suites your lifestyle and commitments. Here are some options:\n- Monastic\n\t- This is most suitable for people who have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that only comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well\n\t- Applies to people like Donald Knuth where he spends his time on computer programming or Neal Stephanson, writing science fiction novels. These people usually have a single point of focus in their lives (novels for Neal Stephanson; to produce accessible forms of computer science knowledge to people, for Donald Knuth)\n\t- This may not apply to people who have meetings to attend to at work, and other shallow commitments that are a requirement to fulfill\n- Bimodal\n\t- Define a clearly defined stretch of time in a week to deep work and leave the rest open to everything else. However, the amount of time has to be substantially long (at least a full day) for one to reach maximum cognitive load.\n\t- This method of deep work is best suited to those who have committments that involve shallow tasks, whether they like it or not (most people).\n\t- Carl Jung used split his time between his retreat and treating patients in his clinic. Adam Grant, the Wharton professor, split his time between teaching in fall, and research in summer and spring. They used bimodal depth philosophies.\n\t- The key to making this work is to make yourself unavailable during deep work periods, and totally accessible during open work times. The hope is people working with you will come to accept this work modality.\n- Rhythmic\n\t- In this philosophy, you commit yourself to habits where you work deeply at a prescribed time. You could also create for yourself a calendar where you mark your deep work, and as you build up a work streak, you will be hesitant to break it.\n\t- The mode of work is most suitable to office workers\n\t- This seems to be a very short time-scale implementation of the bimodal approach. The difference between this method and the bimodal method is elucidated clearly by Newport.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach will not produce the level of depth that bimodal would, but this form of work is much more suitable to reality.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach is capable of logging more deep work hours in a given year compared to bimodal, by its sheer repetitive nature.\n- Journalistic\n\t- Here, you fit in deep work at any time you get a chance to. You should have the ability to quickly sink into deep concentration and work deeply. \n\t- This is something that is only acquired by practice and is not often suitable for a beginner. A beginner will likely quickly deplete willpower reserves. Also, one must have the conviction that the work at hand is important, which usually only happens to already accomplished people.\n\t- The journalist Walter Isaacson apparently worked on his book any chance he got. Newport also admits to using this technique to write this book. Although not as spontaneous, he mapped out in advance any free time he had to write this book.\n\n**==Ritualize==**\n\nCompletely ignore the need for inspiration to do deep work, and create idiosyncratic rituals to minimize all friction in getting to work. A ritual can be designed around the following considerations:\n1. Specify a location for your deep work, and decide how long you will work.\n2. Define rules and metrics, such as no internet, external communication, or words typed in a fixed time interval\n3. Minimize all friction required to do work. Use good stationary, appropriate computer peripherals, computer files ready to go, coffee if you need it.\n\nThese principles cement into your mind that your deep work is the highest priority and needs this kind of committment.\n\n**==Make Grand Gestures==**\n\nIncrease the perceived importance of a task by making a *grand gesture* that often involves significant effort or energy. Here are some fun examples:\n- J.K. Rowling checked into the 5-star Balmoral Hotel to finish the last Harry Potter book. Physicist \n- Physicist and novelist, Alan Lightman retires to a remote island in Maine with no phone access. \n- William Shockley invented the junction transistor by locking himself in a Chicago hotel. \n- Entrepreneur Peter Shankman found that he wrote best when on a plane. So to meet a deadline, he booked a round trip flight to Japan and wrote for the next 30 hours.\n\n**==Don't Work Alone==**\n\nSo far in the book, it seems that going solo is the only way to work deeply at all. However, collaboration and interaction with others is an important aspect in creative work. *The whiteboard effect*, a term coined by Newport to describe the phenomenon where your collaborator pushes you into deeper work, than when you were working alone. This is the basis of the \"open-workspace\" concept applied in offices today, and it seems to have it's origins in Building 20, in MIT, where this lab produced an enormous amount of work ranging from the first solar cell, to fiber optics. This hastily constructed lab in MIT housed people of multiple unrelated disciplies working together, and this is the often cited reasons for why open workspaces work. \n\nHowever, Newport argues that even Building 20 has a \"hub-and-spoke\" architecture, where people congregated in hubs to discuss ideas and then retreated to their spoke to work deeply. I recommend reading this chapter for more reasoning of why this is so, and how it works. In contrast, our open workspace offices provide nothing but constant distraction. The key to successful collaboration is treat interaction and deep work as two separate entities, and therefore need to be optimized separately. Do collaborate when necessary, but be cautious to not overdo it, at the cost of your own ability to do deep work.\n\n**==Execute like a business==**\n\nIn this section, Newport explains how he adapted a book titled \"The 4 Disciplines of Execution\" - a book about corporate strategy - to how to spend more time working deeply. The four \"adapted\" disciplines as related to deep work are:\n\n1. **Focus on the wildly important**: Identify and work on a small number of ambitious outcomes\n2. **Act on Lead Measures**: Lag measures are metrics evaluated after a relevant span of time, but lead measures are metrics that can be evaluated immediately towards a goal. Instead of defining a lag measure like, \"I will write X papers this year\", adopt a lead measure like, \"I will spend 4 hours in deep work everyday.\"\n3. **Keep a compelling scoreboard**: Setup a real scoreboard that measures the amount of time spent in deep work. A simple way is to write down deep work hours in a calendar, and mark off important milestones achieved to indicate how many deep work hours were required to achieve that goal.\n4. **Create a cadence of accountability**: Setup a weekly review with yourself to go over your deep work count, identify wins and losses, and make course corrections for the next week.\n\n**==Be Lazy==**\n\nGiving yourself time to recover from deep work, so that you can attack the next day with the same intensity is vitally important. To ensure this happens, Newport suggests that one invents a shutdown routine you go through to tell your mind that the work for the day is done, and from that point on, you do not apply your mind to any work activity. Here are some reasons why shutting down is important:\n\n1. **Downtime aids insights**: A well rested mind is capable of making much better connections between ideas, and improves creativity and problem solving.\n2. **Downtime helps recharge**: Directed attention, like willpower, is finite, and is easily exhausted. To replenish our reserves, we need downtime where our mind is put at ease by engaging in relaxing activities.\n3. **Working during downtimes results in poor quality**: Our capacity for deep work in a day is limited to about 4 hours, which you should fit into your workday. Any work done outside of that is usually of poor quality.\n\nThe need for a shutdown ritual is important when considering the Zeigernik effect- which points out that incomplete tasks will dominate our attention. Note that the task need not actually be completed, but we need to devise a way to trick the brain into thinking that it's completed, at least for now. This is where a strict shutdown ritual helps, and it can be something like this:\n\n1. Review all incomplete tasks, goals and projects\n2. Make sure you have a plan for it's completion\n3. Capture all the details in a place you will revisit when the time is right\n4. Verbally declare the day complete (\"Shutdown complete\" or \"That's enough for the day\")\n\nNow, your obligations has been released from your brain, and your recovery period begins. \n\u003e[!quote] When you work, work hard. When you're done, you're done.\n\n### Rule 2: Embrace Boredom\n\nLike most skills, the ability to work deeply and concentrate intensely cannot be gained overnight. Much like anything else, it requires repeated and deliberate practice. However, it is not sufficient to simply practice concentrating on a task. We must actively work on minimizing our distractions. \n\nWith the ubiquity of smart phones, we have the ability to distract ourselves at a moments notice, when we are standing in line at the grocery store, or when we are waiting for a friend to arrive, by getting on social media or checking news and email. Unless we work on staving off the need to distract ourselves, there is no way our ability to concentrate will improve. We must *embrace boredom*. This chapter outlines some strategeies to minimize distraction and practise focus.\n\n**==Take breaks from focus, instead of breaks from distraction==**\n\nA popular strategy to break away from distracton addiction is to take an Internet Sabbath, a day devoid of any digital devices, once every week. Newport suggests an alternative, where instead of taking a break from distraction so you can focus, you instead take a break from focus for distraction.\n\nFor example, schedule in advance when you will use the internet by writing down on a notepad the exact time you will allowed to browse the internet. This will force ourselves not to reach for distraction at the slightest hint of boredom.\n\n- This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use / emails\n\t- You will just need to schedule more internet blocks to get the job done\n- Time outside of internet blocks should be absolutely free from internet use\n\t- If you find the need to get a piece of information online to do your job offline, you must resist the temptation to go online immediately, but instead wait for your next online block to roll by. Even take a break to relax if you have to.\n\t- If you happen to go online during an offline block, you will risk running in distractions in the form of urgent emails or messages from people.\n- Schedule internet use at home as well\n\t- This will help unplug from social media and news when at home.\n\t- Only exceptions are time sensitive internet use, like co-ordinating with a friend for dinner.\n\nTo reiterate, the key strategy is to avoid going online at the slightest hint of boredom. This is something to be practiced mindfully, and one must take every opportunity to do so - for exapmle, when waiting in line at the grocery store.\n\n**==Work like Teddy Roosevelt==**\n\nTheodore Roosevelt had an amazing array of interests ranging from body building to naturalism, but he still did well in his classes at Harvard. He was not at the top of his class but he did quite well. His interests left him very little time to actually focus on academics and therefore he worked on school work for only short periods of time but with *blistering intensity*.\n\nHere is how we can adopt this strategy: identify a deep work, high priority task and give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces the time usually taken to do such a task. Make it even harder by publicly proclaiming that deadline, and set a countdown timer and set to work on it. Newport calls such work periods *Roosevelt Dashes*.\n\nAlways make sure you keep Roosevelt dashes on the edge of feasibility, where the successful completion of the task will require levels of concentration higher than usual. It provides interval training for the brain.\n\n**==Meditate Productively==**\n\nProductive meditation is when you focus your attention on a mental task such as outlining an article, or solving a hard problem, while walking, jogging or showering. And whenever you mind starts to wander from the topic you intended to meditate on, you forcibly bring your attention back to the topic at hand.\n\nNewport suggests that two or three such sessions in a week is sufficient, and finding such time blocks is usually easy because it is usually easy to occupy between chores and other tasks on which time would otherwise be spent without thinking anyway.\n\nHere are some potential pitfalls to watch out for:\n- Be wary of distractions and looping\n\t- If you attention is slipping away, gently remind yourself that you're supposed to be thinking about something else, and you can address the distraction later.\n\t- Avoid looping the same thought over and over, which is what happens when addressing a hard problem. Push the mind to go beyond the usual thought process.\n- Structure your deep thinking\n\t- Clearly define what question you are looking to answer\n\t- Gather all the relevant variables and commit them to working memory\n\t- At the end of the session, consolidate your thoughts by reviewing the answer you have come up with\n\n**==Memorize a deck of cards==**\n\nIn this section, Newport goes fairly into depth about strategies for memorizing a deck of cards, and the details are best read from the book itself and are not worth repeating here unless you intend to memorize a deck of cards (which I don't).\n\nThe key takeaway here is that training your memory often leads to an increase in concentration, and any kind of mental training  you can undertake to improve memory will result in concentration gains.\n\n### Rule 3: Quit Social Media\n\nIn this chapter, Newport argues that Social Media has its place in society and the level of adoption in your personal life should be considered with care. The binary nature of the title of this chapter is not what he actually suggests, knowing that many people could either not stick to completely quitting social media, or that some walks of life actually do benefit from social media. So he offers a more nuaced approach.\n\nSocial media is a tool. Like any craftsman, the tool should be adopted only if it's positive impacts substantially outweights its negative impacts. Before adopting every social media platform, ask yourself what the impact is, and then evaluate carefully.\n\n- Identify high level goals in your professional and personal life.\n- List a few activities that help you achieve these goals.\n- Consider the \"network-tools\" like social media, chat, etc, that you use\n- Ask if the tool has a positive, negative, or minimal impact on the listed activities\n- Keep the tool only if positive impact *substantially* outwights the negative impacts\n\nEven if these tools do positively contribute, but only to a small extent, consider not adopting the tool at all. High impact activities that contribute heavily to the overall outcome should be prioritized instead.\n\nActually do try quitting social media for a month and see how it goes. Do you miss people? Do people miss you? What impact does it have on your life? Based on the outcome, you can always get back into it. But if your life has improved as a result of quitting, consider keeping it that way.\n\nArnold Bennett, an English writer, suggests in his self-help classic - *How to live on 24 hours a day* - that there is plenty of time outside of the 8 hour work period where one can focus on self-improvement of various kinds. What this means today is - you can and should make *deliberate* use of your time outside work. Avoid using the internet as a source of entertainment at all time. By no means should you avoid watching a movie or show on TV, but do so with intention. Put more thought into your leisure time. For this, structured hobbies such as reading, music or woodworking are an excellent way to spend free time with intention.\n\nThe argument that working eight hours in the day will tire your mental faculties so much that you will not be able to spend leisure time with intention is a myth. Arnold Bennett writes-\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúWhat? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change‚Äînot rest, except in sleep.‚Äù\n\nIn summary, give your brain a quality alternative to relaxation other than social media and online entertainment. Learn to live, not just exist.\n\n### Rule 4: Drain the Shallows\n\nFind ways to tame shallow work in your day to day life because it is usually not as important as it seems. It has a habit of dangerously eating into your deep work time. Sadly, most knowledge work has some amount of shallow work. It is prudent to schedule shallow work after we have exhausted our capacity for deep work.\n\nNewport suggests three main strategies to minimize shallow work.\n\n==**Schedule Every Minute**==\n- Newport suggests that one must schedule every minute, and chart out a plan on paper with \"task-blocks,\" which are free to expand and contract as the work needs. If disrupted, one simply rearranges the task-blocks and continues. If an important insight shows up, then it is okay to abandon all task-blocks for the rest of the day.\n- I've actually tried this before I read the book, and it gets exhausting after some time. I'm not sure it works for me.\n- The key takeaway is to be *intentional* with your time, and make sure you do not slip into autopilot mode.\n\n==**Quantify the depth of every activity**==\n- To quantify the depth of a task, ask how long (in months) it would take to train a recent smart college grad with no specialized training to do the task? If the answer is many months, then the task clearly has some depth. After sorting tasks by quantifying them, prioritize deep work over shallow.\n\n==**Ask your boss for a shallow work budget**==\n- Anywhere between 30-50% is a reasonable ask for purely shallow work. Anything more than 50%, and you will be viewed as a hermit with deep thoughts. Anything less than 30%, and there is a fear you won't respond to email.\n- You maintain the ratio of these work types, you will have to say no to shallow tasks like weekly sync meetings, and instead ask for a more results driven interaction, where you meet when there are results to report.\n- If your boss insists that you are still required to respond immediately to responses, even if they do interrupt, then it is time to look for a new position that values depth in work.\n\n==**Finish your work by 5:30pm**==\n- *Fixed schedule productivity* - where you need to finish your work by a given time of day, requires you to ruthlessly say no to anything that will not allow you to do deep work. At this point, you will be forced to adopt a scarcity mindset and find all ways to minimize shallow work.\n\n==**Become hard to reach**==\n- Make people who send you email do more work, by setting conditions that the emailer has to satisfy, so that they can expect a response from you. Newport calls this a sender filter. For example, you can blatantly state that you will respond only if interests match. There is nothing offensive in doing this.\n- Do more work when  you send emails. Newport suggests that you use process centric emails to respond to people, instead of responding in an open ended fashion. Attempt to provide enough details or outline enough steps that the email sender has a clear picture of what needs to be done next. This will minimize the number of emails you receive, and also close the loop on the issue at hand.\n- Don't respond. Adopt a mentality that the default reaction is not to respond at all. This might not work in all situations.","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Tsividis-1987-Ch1":{"title":"Operation and Modeling of the MOS Transistor","content":"\n![tsividis](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wL-KP1sNL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n\n\n## 1.2 Semiconductors\n\nWe will deal with silicon as semiconductor, and assume that it is in thermal equilibrium without any external influences.\n\n### Properties of semiconductors\n\n- A silicon crystal has a lattice of atoms held together in a three-dimensional structure called a [[crystal lattice]].\n- Atoms are held together using a [[valence bond]] associated with the electron of the atom. In absolute zero, these electrons exactly counteract the positive charge in the electron's nucleus\n- With thermal energy, the electron is knocked loose from the atom and becomes a [[free electron]] which can now freely move throught the lattice, and can cause electric current to flow\n- The resulting positive charge is called a [[hole]] and can also move through the lattice by electrons from neighboring atoms filling the hole and becoming positive themselves.\n\n\n\n\n## 1.5 The PN junction\n\n### Without external bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-no-external-bias.png]]\n\n- N-type and P-type semiconductors are brought together to make a PN junction. When the doping changes from one type to another abruptly it is called a *step* junction.\n- There are metallic contacts on either extreme of materials where connection to the external world is made.\n- Due to the concentration difference across the interface of these two regions:\n\t- Electrons will diffuse from the n-region to the p-region, leaving behing positivitly charged donor atoms\n\t- Holes will diffuse from the p-region to the n-region leaving behind negatively charged acceptor atoms\n- An electric field builds up internal to the PN junction due to the ionized impurities in either region, and the direction of the field goes from the n- to p-region.\n\t- Any further holes diffusing from p- to n-type, will be repelled by this field\n\t- Any further electron diffucing from n- to p-type will be repelled by this field\n- The potential difference across this region is called the ==built-in potential== of the junction, and is denoted by $\\phi_{bi}$.\n\t$$\\phi_{bi} = \\phi_{Fp}-\\phi_{Fn}$$\n\twhere, $\\phi_{Fp}$ and $\\phi_{Fn}$ are the Fermi potentials of the p-side and n-side respectively.\n- This will result in a region in each doped semiconductor which is devoid of any free charges. This is called the ==depletion region==.\n* If n-type is more heavily doped (as shown in figure), then the depletion width $d_1$ in the n-type region is lesser than $d_2$ in the p-type region, because there are more carriers per unit area, which means more charge can be uncovered in relatively short depth. \n* If n-type is heavily doped so that $N_D \u003e\u003e N_A$,  then most of the potential is dropped across the p-type region, and $\\phi_2 \\approx \\phi_{bi}$\n* The depletion width $d_1$ will be very small and $d_2$ can be calculated as :\n$$\nd_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s}{qN_A}}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n- The charge per unit area on the p-side is given by\n$$\nQ'_2=-\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_sN_A}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n\n### With forward bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-forward-bias.png]]\n\n- If a positive voltage V is applied to the p-side, the junction is forward biased\n- The external voltage will lower the builtin potential to $\\phi_{bi}-V$\n- The electrons supplied from the negative terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some of the charges in the depletion region on the n-side, and the holes supplied from the positive terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some charges in the depletion region on the p-side\n- The overall depth of the depletion regions on each side will decrease\n- Electrons and holes do not face as much as a potential barrier and will cross over from one side to the other in the pn junction resulting in the flow of current which is\n$$\nI = I_0(e^{V/\\phi_t}- 1)\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ depends on the pn junction doping and geometry, and $\\phi_t$ is the thermal voltage.\n\n### With reverse bias\n![[images/pn-junction-reverse-bias.png]]\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-razavi-microelec":{"title":"Fundamentals of Microelectronics","content":"\n![razavi-microelec](https://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/47/11196951/1119695147.jpg)\n\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n\n- The biasing provided to circuits should be independent of:\n\t- Voltage variation: Eg, the voltage from a battery drops as it discharges slowly\n\t- Temperature variation: Eg, different environments / places have different ambient temperatures\n\n- How does temperature affect the operation of circuits?\n\t- ![[images/impractical-biasing-of-mos-bjt-transistors.jpeg]]\n\t\n\t* BJT example\n\t\t* For a desired current $I_1$,\n\t\t\t* $$\n\t\t\t\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{cc}=V_T ln\\frac{I_1}{I_S}\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t* even if resistors are made of same material, and vary the same amount, $V_T$ and $I_S$ vary with temperature, resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\t- FET example\n\t\t- For a desired current $I_1$\n\t\t\t- $$\n\t\t\tI_1= \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_nC_{ox}(\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{DD}-V_{TH})^2\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t- Even if resistors vary the same amount, mobility $\\mu_n$ and threshold voltage $V_{TH}$ vary with temperature resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\n- It is possible to design a circuit called [[Band Gap Reference]] that can provide voltage- and temperature independent voltage and currents, but this uses 10's of transistors and is fairly complex.\n-  The idea is to generate a golden reference current (or voltage) from a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit, and merely \"copy\" that reference current to wherever it is needed in the whole circuit. The circuit that does the copying is called a current mirror\n\n\n---\n\n## ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\nThe basic idea is to use the current generated from a golden source like a bandgap reference circuit and use that to generate a voltage, which will then be applied to another transistor to generate a copy of the current.\n\n### Circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the logarithm of its input current\n\n![[images/output-voltage-proportional-to-input-current.jpeg|200x200]]\n\nA diode connected bipolar transistor does exactly this. The relationship of voltage $V_1$ to the current $I_{ref}$ is \n$$\nV_1 = V_Tln\\frac{I_{REF}}{I_{S,REF}}\n$$\nwhere $I_{S,REF}$ is the saturation current of the reference transistor.\n\nLet us construct the whole current source now.\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\nThe voltage at the base of transistors Q1 and Q2 is proportional to the natural logarithm of the reference current from the bandgap reference circuit, and is a result of the diode connected transistor Q1. Transistor Q2 takes the voltage at its base and creates a \"copy\" or \"mirrors\" the current to the output side, provided transistors Q1 and Q2 are identical to each other, or some integer multiple thereof.\n\nSo, how does this solve the temperature sensitivity issue? The voltage at the base of the transistors does vary with temperature. But since Q1 and Q2 are identical, they are affected in the same way by temperature. As a result, the copied current is insensitive to temperature.\n\n## ![[permanent/Using a current mirror to create multiple copies, multiples, or fractions of a reference current]]\n\n- Once the $V_{BE}$ voltage has been generated from the reference current (that uses bandgap reference) using the diode connected transistor, it can be used as the $V_{BE}$ for several output transistors.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5, then you can create 3 copies of the reference current.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5 and then tie their collectors together, you can create one 3X copy of the reference current\n\t- If you size the reference transistor to be 3 parallel transistors, and have only one output transistor, you can generate fractional 1/3 current copies.\n\t- If you have a reference transistor of size 3X, and output transistors of size 1X and 12X, you can generate both multiplier and fractional current copies (1/3rd and 4X in this case)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Effect of base current\n\n# References\n\n- Behzad Razavi, Fundamentals of Microelectronics, 2013, Wiley, Chapter 9\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/Building-Your-Brand-How-I-Reached-10k-Subscribers-in-6-Months":{"title":"","content":"# Building Your Brand: How I Reached 10k Subscribers in 6 Months\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9ff90f-b0ca-4149-b285-997138eb6dcc_1704x1194.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Jordan Cutler]]\n- Full Title: Building Your Brand: How I Reached 10k Subscribers in 6 Months\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://careercutler.substack.com/p/building-your-brand-how-i-reached\n\n## Highlights\n- Sharing what you know or are learning helps you learn better.

The idea to use pieces to make simple things and then use those simple things to create something more complex. The hierarchy of components one could hypothetically build can be quite \"deep\", and this is where the name comes from. \n\nWhen building a learning model from simpler learning models, the \"pieces\" have to \"fit\" together much like lego blocks do. A simple piece of a learning model can be built with two fundamental operations:\n1. Matrix multiplication\n2. Activation function\n\nThis simple piece constructed from the basic operations above is called a ==fully connected layer==.\n\nTo push the lego analogy further, you can connect several fully-connected layers to build what is called a ==multi-level perceptron-==.\n\nOne of the highly cited papers that shows this Lego action in practice is Szegedy et al 2014 (insert Zotero link). They describe the design of the Inception multilevel perceptron used to classify images.\n\nOne of the other important advantages of Deep Learning is that the learning model only gets better with more and more training data.  This is in contrast to other models like Tree-Based models that stop getting better after a certain amount of data. Also, for decision tree based ML, one cannot sufficiently cover all possible scenarios with \"if\" conditions. The model simply does not get better anymore. xkcd.com/1838\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Pytorch-Day1":{"title":"","content":"Instructor: Ben Sherman from Weights and Biases\n\n### What are AI ML and DL?\n\n- Deep learning is a specific form of machine learning.

Lower is better.\n\t- Prediction comes from model.forward\n\t- compare that to the known correct value\n\t- Calculate loss (rms error is one kind)\n\n- One hot vector -- vectorized representation of the correct answer.\n\n```python\ntrained_model = Model.fit(training_inputs, known_outputs)\n```\n\nUsing fit to make a model better\n```python\nuntrained_model = Model()\nuntrained_outputs = untrained_model.forward(training_inputs)\nuntrained_loss = loss(untrained_outputs, training_targets)\n\ntrained_model = untrained_model.fit(training_inputs, training_targets)\n```\n\nWhen is a model good?\n- Make sure that loss in production is better than a certain number.\n\n### Perceptrons\n\nDigit recognition problem is the helloworld of ML!\n- Could you identify handwritten digits using Python?\n- Rules based methods based on conditions will not work for something like this\n\nFrank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron 1960 to solve such problems. How did his machine work?\n- uses variable resistors whose value can be set by knobs, and a light that turns on\n- Imagine you have a knob for each pixel in image of 5\n- Set the knobs so that light turns on when the number is 5\n- You just trained the perceptron\n\nMathematical model of a perceptron\n- Multiply each input by a weight (like the knobs)\n- Sum all the weighted inputs\n- Pass the sum through an activation function (like the lightbulb)\n\nFirst two steps is the dot product of the input vector and weight vector. You can add a constant to it if needed. This simple linalg solves super fast on GPU\n\nIn pytorch, this is called a `Linear` block.\n\n- Break the input dataset into batches (like 32 out the 1000)\n\t- this is needed because datasets can be really really big\n- Dataloaders do this, the behave like lists\n- One pass through of entire dataset while adjusting weights in reponse to the inputs is called an ==epoch==\n- \n\nUse `Trainer.fit` in pytorch lightning to do the fit.\n- Iterates over Dataloader\n- calls ==Optimizer== to set the weights\n- minimizes loss\n\nSigmoid (S-shaped) functions work much better than linear activation functions\n\nRecognizing structures and patterns in data is known as ==feature detection==. Example, the strokes involved in creating the number 5. horizontal line on top, vertical line on left, and backwards C shape.\n\nSo train a model for each of the three features. A fully connected layer (perceptron + act func) to detect horizontal line, vertical line and backwards C. Connect all the 3 fully connected layers, to create a multilayer perceptron to detect a 5. In Pytorch this is done using `Sequential`\n\nBut how do we modify this to increase dimensionality of the outputs? Dont just identify the digit (5 or not) but tell me the digit it is. This is where we need probablity calculation. This is done using `softmax` function. Take the multidimensional output and run it through softmax.\n\nSoftmax gives you an array of probabilities. But we want an array of zeros and ones. to finally identify the digit. RMS error is a bad way to compare this and has high error. People mostly use the ==cross entropy== function.\n\nhttps://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io\n\nHow does the .fit work?\n\n- All neural network fitting schemes uses local optimization. Descend the surface of the loss function. Uses calculus to descend the loss function surface. Compute gradient of loss function wrt any given point on the surface. Then follow that till gradient is zero. Gradient descent algorithm. \n- Downside to local optimization can always give false minima\n\n- Gradient descent algorithm possibly with \"Momentum\" is usually the first choice for optimizers. Sometimes ADAM or RMSProp works better.\n- Recommendation: better to try different optimizers, than mess with config of optimizer you are using.\n- Look into Backpropagation algorithm too, its really beautiful mathematically. OpenAI blog post has a great article. This blog is also very good for ML. Also mentioned 3blue1brown videos -\u003e Look at his deep learning videos.\n- Batchnorm -- normalize the inputs to be within some some range of numbers, so that activation functions dont become unresponsive\n\n2 minute courses -- research topics\nfastAI - courses on YT and notebooks\nfull stack deep learning course YT\nweights and biases YT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Pytorch-Day2":{"title":"","content":"\n### Review\n- A fully connected network does \"non-deep\" learning. It is only by connecting them to create multilayer perceptrons, or deep neural networks, that are capable of \"deep\" learning.\n\n### Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)\n\n- Instead of using Linear layers, they use ==Conv2D== layers. Linear layers tend to flatten the image being process and weight them. Conv2D layer looks at in as a 2D plane.\n- The process takes an array of pixels, and outputs a single number.. So by scanning conv2D layers, you construct a new 2D map. This process is called builing a \"Feature Map\".\n- AlexNet is a famous neural net that improved computer vision that came out in 2013.\n\n*you need to construct these notes with images from the originial slide set*\n\n- This convolution process is trying to identify some \"feature\" in the picture.\n- You usually train a bunch of convolutions for the different features you want to extract. Each of them will generate a new array of information. Each feature you are looking for requires a different \"kernel\" used for convolution. For say 10 features, will give you 10 \"channels\" that tells you about the \"feature\" you were looking for in that image. This blows up the problem size!\n- How to get around this?  Use a Max pooling layer.\n\t- you take a grid of numbers and just choose the max value in the grid. this down samples the image. Higher number means that its a greater presence of the feature you are looking for.

It serves as a basis to hit all the important requirements from an exercise routine, to optimize health and fitness. A beginner starting out, or an individual who is solely interested in staying fit, and not really training for specialized athletic performance should simply follow the foundational protocol for fitness. If you are trying to be more specific, like train for a marathon, or simply build muscle for asthetics, then the exercise routine required will simply overweight the equivalent protocol for that purpose (eg, weight training for muscular [[hypertrophy]])\n\n## What are the different fitness protocol types?\n\n1. Skill\n2. Speed\n3. Strength\n4. Power (Speed x Strength)\n5. Hypertrophy\n6. Muscular Endurance\n7. Aerobic Endurance\n\t1. Over 30 mins (high heart rate)\n\t2. Over 30 mins (lower heart rate)\n\n## How can a weekly workout be designed to hit all these protocols?\n\n### Day 1: Aerobic Endurance (Low heart rate)\nThe main purpose is to maintain [[Zone 2]] heart rate for an extended period of time. You can get this from rowing, cycling or jogging for 60-75 mins. Alternatively, you can go on a long hike (2-3 hours) to mix it up. If you really find that easy, use a weighted vest or a ruck sack during the long hike.\n\n### Day 2: Hypertrophy - Lower Body\nPrimarily focus on weights and do a heavy volume set to really push legs close to failure on 2-3 sets at least. The main purpose is to target the quads, hamstring and calves. \n\nLeg muscles are very large musicles and working them out early in the week sets up for better metabolism and hormones throughout the week. But make sure that legs are not too tired from Day 1 exercise.\n\n### Day 3: Heat and Cold Cycling  (Recovery)\nThe purpose here is to activate various mechanisms involved in hot and cold therapy for which there is a lot of material out there. But essentially, do a 20 min sauna followed by a 45-50F ice bath. Do not go colder on this until you are sure you will not get hypothermia. This will also accelerate recovery from a leg workout the previous day. Maybe go for a walk to ensure that you hit a target of 200m [[Zone 2]] cardio in the week.\n\n### Day 4: Hypertrophy - Upper Body\nDo a weight training session for the torso, where you will do bench / shoulder presses, bent over rows, pull ups, etc. Ensure that you getting both pushing and pulling (or eccentric and concentric) exercises. Do a good heavy volume set that will build your chest and back muscles. Note that we are not working out biceps / triceps etc here.\n\n### Day 5:  Aerobic/Muscular Endurance (High heart rate)\nDo a run, row or cycle where your heart rate is much higher than Zone 2 and is typically about 80% of your heart rate maximum (calculated as 220-age). So for a 40 year old, that would be a sustained heart rate of ~145bpm.\n\n\n---\n\n### Day 6: Speed, Strength, Power (High intensity, Max HR, 2nd leg day)\nDo a [[HIIT]] style training with a focus on working out the legs specifically. One simple example is you can sprint with maximum effort for 30s and rest for 10s, and repeat this for 5 times at least. The goal is to do explosive exercises for your legs generally, and keep the volume low. But you will aim to hit absolute maximum heart rate (~180bpm for a 40 year old) for at least a few minutes, till you feel your heart wanting to explode out of your chest. With the focus on legs, this will serve as a 2nd lower body workout too.\n\n### Day 7: Hypertrophy - Arms, Calves, Neck\nThis is the second day of hypertrophy for upper body with an emphasis on biceps, triceps, calves, and neck. Yes, neck muscles are very important to be strong too. It may save you from whiplash and maybe even death.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE]\n\u003e Concepts are few, but methods are many\n\u003e *Andy Galpin*\n\n## What are some general training guidelines useful for this?\n\n- For a 1 hour workout session, do about 10 mins of warmup followed by 50 mins of ==hard work==.\n- For muscle work, do it twice a week for upper and lower body. First time, do heavy weights and high intensity. Second time, do moderate weights but [[HIIT]] style.\n- When picking exercises, use both push and pull types of exercies. Loading on both concentric and eccentric motions are important.\n- Use an alternating weight strategy every month, to keep it simple and reduce injury.\n\t- Odd months : Lower reps, heavy weights -\u003e more sets, long rest times (2-4mins)\n\t- Even months: Higher reps, lower weights -\u003e fewer sets, short rest times (0.5-2mins)\n- Limit your exercises to only those you **can** do, and do it **==WITH PERFECT FORM==**\n\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/P-Resistance-Training-Patrick":{"title":"Resistance training for time efficiency, body composition, and maximum hypertrophy with Brad Schoenfeld","content":"\n### Why should we be resistance training?\n\n- If you were to pick one form of exercise, it should be resistance training\n- It gives all benefits of cardio in addition to:\n\t- Muscle and bone strength\n\t\t- Osteoporosis (esp for women) is a possibility with age\n\t\t- Resistance training makes muscle pull on the bone, and strengthens the bone\n\t\t- Weight bearing exercise strengthens bone, not other forms of exercise\n\t\t- Cycling, swimming, and other forms of cardio does not help bone density, maybe running is ok to some extent\n\t\t- Compound motions like squats, rows, presses, pushups are very helpful for bone density\n\t\t- Even \u003e70 yr olds see massive improvements in muscle strength when they start lifting, in 8-12 weeks, even if they have never training before.\n\t\t\t- But always start early.

You can stave off bone density loss in old age, but it is better to have a good reserve to start with\n\t\t- Resistance training does not stunt growth, this is a myth, there is no evidence for this\n\t\t- Even kids 6-8 yrs can start resistance training, and helps with bone density. But they should be supervised, and not get themselves injured.

Exercise is adjunct at that point. \n- Cardio is more for increasing energy expenditure.\n- It is important to combine resistance training with calorie restriction to contribute to weight loss. If you do only cardio and no resistance training, you will lose both muscle and fat. No recomposition will happen. Resistance training maintains muscle mass.\n- The more weight you have to lose, the easier it is to recomp.\n- If you have been training for a long time, then it is harder to recomp. Noob gains is a real thing.\n- If you want to bulk up, then you cannot guarantee that you will maximize muscle. You need to be at equal calorie needs or at a slight surplus.\n\n### Nutrition requirements for muscle mass\n- Can I have plenty of protein intake while meeting calorie deficit, but not do resistance training?\n\t- No. You have to do resistance training.\n\t- but it really depends, maybe if you are very obese then you will lose fat first\n\t- But even if you are normal, you need a lot of protein to maintain muscle\n- Need 1.6-1.8g / kg which is about 2X the RDA. No really downsides, no liver damage, etc.\n\t- This number is calculated for people who are lean - about 15-20% body fat. If you are obese, then you need to target the lower weight for protein intake calculations.\n\t- Protein is very diffcult to store as body fat.\n\t- Older people need even more protein due to reduced anabolism. They need more leucine to kickstart the muscle growth.\n- Whole foods are the best for protein intake, but protein shakes are ok if you are not meeting your requirements.\n- Dont need leucine supplements if you are taking in animal based protein. They are quality proteins that are rich in leucine.\n- 4oz of chicken = 30g of protein\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/literature/Why-Engineers-Need-to-Write":{"title":"","content":"# Why Engineers Need to Write\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F563950db-225a-4580-8083-c68bf3de222a_1200x800.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Ryan Peterman]]\n- Full Title: Why Engineers Need to Write\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://www.developing.dev/p/why-engineers-need-to-write\n\n## Highlights\n- I hated writing in high school.

Trying to capture every single thought as a note you will need forever\n- You think that every single thought, idea, or concept is equally important and that it is best to file everything away for when you need it. In other words, you treat every note as a permanent note.\n- This creates a large quantity of notes, that you cannot link to other notes in your system in any reasonable way.\n- Such notes cannot be found later, and the complexity involved in remembering the existance of the note makes the system messy.\n \n### 2. You take only project related notes\n- When you decide on the project that you want to work on, you collect information required for the project only. This means that for every project, you have to restart the process, and there is no reuse from your readings on past projects. This is inefficient.\n- You come across ideas not relevant to current projects so you skip taking notes on them. This is a valuable loss of insight that might be highly application and even translate into a great idea for a future project.\n\n### 3. You treat every note as temporary and never convert them into meaningful notes\n- You treat every note as a fleeting note. You write ideas down on a scratch paper, and these pile up when you dont process them in any way, and soon you will forget their context and significance.\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n[[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]\n[[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Conventional-writing-methods-are-flawed-right-from-the-start":{"title":"Conventional writing methods are flawed right from the start","content":"\nThe conventional academic research workflow suggests that you first pick a topic to work on, do the necessary research, think about creative solutions, and consolidate your findings in writing.\n\nThere are drawbacks to this method:\n1.

But in reality this is not so. In reality, there will always be a maximum voltage Vmax, or maximum current, Imax, that can be sustained at the device terminals.\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230502112233.png]]\n\nLet's look at some numbers to see why loadline match can deliver more power at the output of a device.\n\nConsider that Ig = 1A and Rgen=100ohms. According to conjugate match, Rload = Rgen, so that,\n$$\nV_o = Ig.(R_{gen}||R_{load}) = 1 \\times 50 = 50V\n$$\nIn the absence of any restrictions, the power delivered to the load is $1A \\times 50V$ = $50W$.\n\nLet us now assume that Imax = 1A and Vmax = 10V, likely limited by the voltage supply used in measurement. In the case of such a restriction, Vmax cannot reach 50V to sustain the 1A from the generator. So the current Ig will be reduced.\n$$\nI_g = 10V / 50\\Omega = 0.2A\n$$\nTotal power delivered to load will be $0.2A \\times 10V = 2W$, which is substantially lower than the $50W$ initially calculated.\n\nTo get the maximum output power in the presence of these restrictions, the load must be set to a loadline match. \n$$\nR_{load}=V_{max}/I_{max}\n$$\nFor the numbers assumed in this example, Rload = 10V/1A = 10ohms. Output power that can be obtained by setting this load value is $1A \\times (100\\Omega || 10\\Omega) \\approx 1A \\times 10\\Omega \\approx 10W$. While this value is nowhere close to the 50W that can hypothetically be obtained from an ideal case, it is still way better than the 2W that can be obtained from a conjugate match.\n\n## References\n\n- Steve Cripps - RF Power Amplifiers for Wireless Communications Chap 1.6\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.065509549Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Mechanism-of-generation-of-ATP-by-mitochondria":{"title":"Mechanism of generation of ATP by mitochondria","content":"\nThe protein protrusions on the external chamber of the mitochondrion capture electrons and pull them into its inner chamber (see [[permanent/Mitochondria and their structure]]).

During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#9a52fd13-5cd9-4c73-9d6f-32f3da7a6bc2) The Barbell Method takes this into account by integrating your reading habit into your [[personal knowledge management]] with two steps:\n\n1. Read the book. Read swiftly but don‚Äôt skip any parts. Mark all the passages that stand out and contain useful, interesting or inspiring information.\n2. Read the book a second time. But now you read the marked parts only. This time you make notes, connect them to past notes ([[zettelkasten]]) and think about what you‚Äôve read. Make mindmaps, drawings, bullet points ‚Äì everything that helps you to think more clearly. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#b40f87c6-361b-429e-9a3c-35bbf6f2cc1e)\n\nThe quality of the book will now determine how much time you invest in it. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#b4c493c0-d685-45aa-b530-0451ad6bc581)\n\nThe first step of the Barbell Method of Reading is just reading. That is a shallow kind of processing that suffices to understand what is easy to understand. You are probing the text and can later decide what you should do with it. You decide on a part-by-part basis.\n\nA text consists of four different types of parts:\n- Useful and difficult to understand. \n\t- You want to process these parts heavily for understanding and exploitation. \n\t- Mark these for later.\n- Useful and easy to understand. \n\t- You want to process these parts heavily for exploitation. \n\t- Mark these for later.\n- Not useful but difficult to understand. \n\t- You actually don‚Äôt want to process these parts but you don‚Äôt know if they are useful. Sharpen your mental theeth with them and then ignore them after you found out that they are not useful.\n- Not useful and easy to understand. \n\t- Ignore these.

They either sit staring at a blank page wondering what to write.\n2. They put so much effort into one piece of content but really have no idea if it will resonate or not with their audience.\n\nBut writers who take a bottom‚Äôs up approach to content creation discover:\n- Their ideas are clarified further the more they write about them.\n- They never start from a blank page because ideas get promoted upwards from tweets to essays to articles and beyond.\n- They always have a good idea of what resonates because ideas have already been tested down the ladder.\n- Their content creation feels effortless because each level builds on the next and the positive signal provides motivation to keep creating.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#0d308495-6d99-4539-aac2-84be58ca70f3) All you have to do is commit to writing one tweet a day.

If you already have an idea it‚Äôs not hard to get it to that next step of 250 words.\n- They are easily consumable. You‚Äôre not asking people to leave the platforms (which Twitter hates) and they can be consumed in mostly less than a minute [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#44f0c1bc-f545-46a2-82fd-2175dc1af2cf)\n I‚Äôve found leaving about a 2-week gap between the original tweet and a follow-up essay creates the best results.

Her dad was the head honcho at a spirits company called Schenley Distilleries.  \n\n(Sidney would later say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to marry a million dollars than to earn it.‚Äù _Wise man)_  \n\nOnce he was in the family, he started working in the family alcohol business, but there was a Jerry-Springer-style dispute, and he got kicked out.  \n\n**At this point, he had two choices:**  \n\n1. Go back to his father-in-law and beg to get back in\n2. Take his learnings and start his own alcohol business\n\nHe chose path 2 aka revenge.  \n\nNow he just needed an idea.  \n\nTo find it, he walked around NYC at night looking for inspiration.  \n\nThen one night he got it. He saw a group of German immigrants drinking a liquor called J√§germeister.  \n\nWhile Jager tasted a bit like cough syrup (and Germans used it for medicinal purposes), Frank thought it was a unique product, and had potential in the US market.  \n\n**So he brought it to the US market and made it explode with his marketing genius.**  \n\nHe created 3 marketing stunts that really helped:  \n\n1. Someone reviewed Jager and said it was an aphrodisiac (increased sex drive). Not true‚Ä¶but Sidney printed hundreds of copies of the newspaper article and handed it to every bar owner in town\n2. He hired women and called them ‚ÄúJagerettes‚Äù (aka, any father‚Äôs worst nightmare). The women would dress up as sexy nurses \u0026amp; doctors and walk around bars spraying Jager into guys' mouths.\n3. He created a cold-tap machine that would keep Jager at the bar at 5 degrees Fahrenheit to make drinking it taste less bad\n\nThose 3 things _really really worked_.  \n\nJager went from selling 500 cases a year in the US when Frank first bought it, to over 7M+ cases by 2016.  \n\n(That‚Äôs 14,000x growth in 40 years)  \n\nBut wait‚Ä¶there‚Äôs more.  \n\nEven though Frank was now RICH, over the age of 70, and his kids‚Äô kids never needed to work again‚Ä¶he decided to start a new company.  \n\nThis time, he decided to go into the Vodka business (shooters gonna shoot).  \n\nAt the time, the only premium vodka on the market was Absolut which sold for $17\\. So, Frank gathered his most trusted advisors and told them to go to France and come back with the best vodka they could find.  \n\nWhy France? Because it sounds fancy. That‚Äôs why.  \n\nHe called it Grey Goose and hired famous artists to design the bottle and packaging.  \n\n**And he packaged it well by nailing these six things:**  \n\n* He priced it 2X more expensive than the previous ‚Äúpremium‚Äù vodka bottle (Absolut)\n* Spent his full first-year profit ($3M) on ads, sponsoring things like high-end charity events and Hollywood award afterparties\n* Packaged it in wooden crates like fine wine\n* Explained that the vodka was filtered through champagne limestone in the French Springs (I don‚Äôt know what this means, but I‚Äôm f\\*cking IN)\n* Created ads explaining it was the first vodka from France instead of dirty old Russia\n* Designed a unique smoky glass bottle that was impossible to forget\n\nSeven years later, Bacardi bought Grey Goose from the Sidney Frank Importing Co. for $2 Billion.  \n\n2 exits in and over $2B made meant it was time for him to spend his money.  \n\nHe hired a financial advisor to ‚Äúteach him how to spend money.‚Äù He had 4 full-time chefs, and traveled in a private jet with 20 people everywhere he went.  \n\nHe loved playing golf and played all the time until he got too old and couldn‚Äôt play...so he hired 4 golf pros to play golf for him for his amusement while he just sat in the golf cart eating and drinking.   \n\n**The lesson?**  \n\nWhen your father-in-law boots you out of the business‚Ä¶ Go big. Get revenge. Become a billionaire.

Did your manager tell you about the project, or did you kick it off with a team? Was the project hand-delivered to you as an assignment, or was it something you figured out?\n- What was your first interaction with the project, and how did you feel going into it? Were you intimated or excited? Eager or annoyed? Why?\n- What was the first thing you did? Not the first thing the team did, but what did you do once you learned about the project? Did you schedule meetings with stakeholders, look through past research, write down everything you knew about the work to come, or something else\n- What was the first (or second) challenge you encountered? How did you feel? What did you do to work through the challenge with others?\n- How did the project typically progress? Did you need to rally the team together regularly, were regular meetings booked by a product manager for you, or did you set up consistent design critiques for the team to give you feedback? Did you do research, and if so, who scheduled it? How did all of that work feel for you?\n- Were there any notable challenges you faced during the project? Call these out! Was there a disagreement between you and someone else? Was there a time you dropped something or failed to meet expectations? How did you recover from those things?\n- Where did the project end up?

They have to discharge slowly through the body-source and body-drain junctions through very slow recombination processes.\n\n## What is the current solution?\n\nFloating body device is made to have faster charge removal mechanisms from the body by increasing the rate of recombination in the body-source / body-drain junctions by engineering the interface to have higher trap states that can provide for extra recombination sites.\n\n## What is the problem with this solution?\n\nRecombination effects are very random and can take very long or very short times to complete. Which means that the LNA has great variablility in its settling time. The recombination rates change by about two orders of magnitude from measurements of a body contacted LNA device. This is causing product failures.\n\n## What is the new solution?\n\nFloating body and body-contacted devices are exactly the same, save for the presence of a body terminal. The reason we cannot use a body-contact LNA device in an LNA is due to linearity and noise issues (from shot noise in the body contact).\n\n\u003e [! Important]\n\u003e A body-contact device with it's body terminal floating, behaves like a floating body device.\n\nHere is the main idea:\n\n- During the switching event in a LNA from one gain state to another, keep the body-terminal at ground potential.\n- After the settling time spec window (~1 $\\mu$s), the body-terminal can be floated to mimic the performance of a floating body device.\n\nThis ensures that there is rapid charge removal from the body of the device during the switching event, enabling the device to settle quickly. After the switching event, the device should provide the performance of a floating-body device which is optimal for LNA use.\n\nWith this in place, there is no use to use special low-latency devices which have engineered traps in the device. Any regular floating body device will do, as long as it has an equivalent body-contacted device.\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.089509563Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Working-principle-of-a-Current-Mirror":{"title":"Working principle of a Current Mirror","content":"A [[permanent/Current Mirror]] copies the golden reference current $I_{ref}$ generated by a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit.\n\n## Circuit Diagram\n\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\n## Explanation\n\n- The purpose of transistor Q1 is to generate an output voltage at its base that is proportional to the input current at the collector.

There are two resistive terminations that will result in this output power.\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230504080723.png]]\n\n#### CASE 1: $R_{LO}=R_{opt}/p$\n\nWhen $R_L=R_{LO}$, the current swings to the value of $I_{max}$, so the resulting peak-peak output voltage will be $V_o=2.I_{max}.R_{opt}/p = 2.V_{dc}/p$\n\n#### CASE 2: $R_{HI}=p.R_{opt}$\n\nWhen $R_L=R_{HI}$, the voltage swings to the value of $V_{ds}$, so the resulting peak-peak output current will be $I_d=2.V_{ds}/(p.R_{opt}) = 2.I_{max}/p$\n\n\nIn both cases, the power delivered to the output is $P_{opt}/p$. You can see on the smith chart that the values of $R_{LO}$ and $R_{HI}$ lie on the real axis. These are two points on the load-pull contour for a given output power.\n\nThe circles that pass through the $R_{LO}$ and $R_{HI}$ points are constance resistance and constant conductance circles. We will see later that this is important to draw power contours for a given output power on the smith chart.\n\n## References\n\n- Steve Cripps - RF Power Amplifiers for Wireless Communications Chap 2.4","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.089509563Z","tags":null},"/permanent/amplifier-output-power-with-reactive-loads":{"title":"amplifier output power with reactive loads","content":"\nWe found two points on a constant power contour by [[permanent/amplifier output matching for specified power|using two different purely resistive loads]]. To build other points on the contour, consider adding reactive elements to the load network.\n\n#### Case 1: Reactance $\\pm jX_m$ in series with a resistive load $R_{LO}$\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230504082345.png]]\n\nThe impact of adding this reactance is that the voltage swing is increased, while the current swing remains at $I_{max}$. But, how does this guarantee constant output power? The answer to this lies in the relative phase between the V and I waveforms. Notice that in the case of [[permanent/amplifier output matching for specified power|purely resistive loads]], the V and I are exactly out of phase, and the peak magnitudes of V and I coincide (sign does not matter for instantaneous power delivered). When it is phase shifted with an added reactance, the V and I waveforms are not exactly out of phase, and therefore the instantaneous power involves the multiplication of two smaller quantities. Thus the average power delivered in both cases is the same.\n\nBut there is a maximum to the reactance that can be added. Remember that the output voltage swing cannot exceed that of the optimal power match case $2V_{DS}$. Thus the maximum magnitude of the load impedance cannot exceed $R_{opt}$. Thus the maximum reactance that can be added is constrained by\n$$\n\\sqrt{R_{LO}^2+X_m^2}=R_{opt}\n$$\nThe arc of constant power that is followed when a series reactance is added, conveniently follows the constant resistance circle of $R=R_{LO}=R_{opt}/p$.\n\n#### Case 2: Susceptance $\\pm jY_m$ in shunt with a resistive load $R_{HI}$\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230504090501.png]]\n\nTo complete the other side of the contour, add a shunt susceptance $jB_m$ in parallel to load resistance $R_L=p.R_{opt}=1/G_{opt}$. In this case, the addition of a parallel element means that the total output voltage is unaffected, but the magnitude of current can be increased by the addition of susceptance. Again, note that the phase shift in the voltage means that the instantaneous power may be different with the addition of susceptance, but the total output power does not change.\n\nIn this case too, the addition of susceptance can only increase output current up to $I_{max}$ which means that the maximum amount of susceptance that can be added is constrained by\n$$\n\\sqrt{G_{HI}^2+B_M^2}=G_{OPT}\n$$\nIn this case, the arc of constant output power follows the constant conductance circle $G=1/(p.R_{opt})$.\n\n\u003e [!warning] Why is it that in both reactance and susceptance cases, the phase of current does not ever change?\n\nWhen you combine the constant power contours due to resistive, reactive and susceptive loads, the resulting power contour, which is a combination of the reactance circle $R_{opt}/p$ and susceptance circle $p.R_{opt}$, results in an ==oblong, rugby ball shaped contour==, which is characteristic of power contours in load pull measurements. They never follow pure circles like that for constant gain.\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230504091859.png]]\n\nIn this figure, the mismatch circles are plotted alongside the power contours. Mismatch circles means points of constant magnitude of  $S_{22}$ on the smith chart. Note that, they do not line up with the power contours. This is evidence that power match contours do not form the way they do because of how $S_{22}$ moves in the presence of a large signal.","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.089509563Z","tags":null},"/permanent/attention-residue":{"title":"attention residue","content":"\nLong stretches of time are required to enter intense focus modes and get [[permanent/deep work]] done, because of attention residue left in the mind when switching over from a previous task.

But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not.

And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile.

The output current in the figure below is shown as a cosine function for ease of analysis.\n\n![[permanent/Pasted image 20230505092738.png|400]]\n\nThe RF current waveform during conduction cycle can be written as:\n$$\ni_d(\\theta)=I_q+I_{pk}.cos(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere, $I_{pk}=I_{max}-I_q$.\n\nAt the end of the conduction cycle, at $\\theta=\\alpha/2$,\n$$\nI_q + I_{pk}.cos(\\alpha/2) = 0\n$$\nor, \n$$\ncos(\\alpha/2)=-I_q/I_{pk}\n$$\nand substituting for $I_{pk}$,\n$$\ncos(\\alpha/2)=\\frac{I_q}{I_q-I_{max}}\n$$\nsolving for $I_q$,\n$$\nI_q = \\frac{I_{max}.cos(\\alpha/2)}{cos(\\alpha/2)-1}\n$$\nNow, we can write $i_d(\\theta)$ only in terms of $I_{max}$ as,\n$$\ni_d(\\theta)= I_{max}\\frac{cos(\\theta)-cos(\\alpha/2)}{1-cos(\\alpha/2)}\n$$\n\nThis is the expression for output current as a function of angle, that will be used to separate the various classes of amplifier operation.\n\n## References\n- Steve Cripps - RF Power Amplifiers for Wireless Communications Chap 3.2","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.093509565Z","tags":null},"/permanent/shallow-work":{"title":"shallow work","content":"\n\u003e[!quote] Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.

It is much more applicable to rfic.io. It is too hard for me to address all  hardware engineers.\n- Can I show how RF data analysis scripts with scikit-RF should be git controlled?\n\t- what kind of code snippets writtin in scikit-rf can be most reused across projects?\n- Address matlab users and show that git is integrated into matlab. Link some articles showing how it should be used.\n- SKILL scripts can be another area to be addressed.\n- Apparently PCB files have been revision controlled using git- link some articles.\n---\n\nGit is so prevalent in the software engineering world yet so few hardware engineers know of it, or use it effectively in their work. But hardware engineers do write and use software code in their day to day work, to do data analysis with python, build various simulation systems with Matlab's Toolboxes, write SKILL code for Virtuoso or perform lab automation with Labview or C-sharp.\n\nRevision controlled code can greatly benefit all these situations to maintain functioning and high quality code that can be reused in the future while making continuous improvements for efficieny, features and accuracy. This usually has payback in terms of getting work done more quickly and correctly in the future.\n\nOne fundamental pain point in a lot of these applications is that git is not built in to the development environments used by engineers. Another reason is the hesitation of hardware engineers to use the command line for doing anything. In such cases, I'd argue that a GUI based version control system is just as fine, as long as the benefits of version control are made available to hardware engineers. To this end, I would recommend getting started with Github desktop as a GUI tool.\n\n\u003c At some point you will have to explain what git and github actually is \u003e\n\nBut what about propreitary information? We do not want to put that up on Github for all to see! That is a valid concern that should cross all our minds as we work on proprietary technologies in our companies. After trade secrets are what pays our bills! \n\nThere are two solutions for this:\n1. If you are not worried about collaboration, and want to version control just the code you develop, then running a git repository entirely local to your computer is the answer. This way, you will not have to sync anything to a central server and risk exposing important information.\n2. If you do have the need to collaborate, then it is worthwhile checking if your organization has a github enterprise server setup for your use. If not, you can request your IT department to see if you can get one set up. This way, you will not have to use github.com as your remote repository server.\n\nLet us look at a rather common use case of git for a hardware engineer. Assume you have a CSV data file that contains measurements of some hardware in the lab, and you are using MATLAB to process the data and perform some analysis.\n\n\u003c You need to work on some code examples  \u003e\n\nHere are the steps you need to do:\n\n- Initialize a git repo with Git GUI for this codebase\n- Check in some files and push to remote repository\n- Make some code updates and commit-push again\n- Show commit history\n- Demonstrate branching and merging\n- Demonstrate forking\n- Making releases and tagging\n\nInvestigate other git flows - command line based, VScode plugin... does Matlab acutally integrate Git now?\n\n\u003c Put in some resources to go deeper into git / github. There are plenty of oneline resources I dont have to go into \u003e\n\nThe main concent behind git is to check in code, and not acyutally check in data. Github has a 50MB file limit that is sufficient to hold about a million lines of code. While, it is possible to store data in Github, it is not intended for that. However, as long as the file size limitations are not a constraint, there is nothing acutally preventing you from version controlling data files. \n\nAnyone in the corporate environment would wonder if Git is useful for word and powerpoint documentation. I wouldn't really recommend using it for such an application since Microsoft's OneDrive integration does provide version control that works much better for something like this.\n\nAlso, if you are ever interested in participating in open source projects, git is something you should know.

We will look at 8 things you should be doing in your 401k that will ensure your retirement savings exceed a million dollars, and even show you ways to contribute up to $66,000 per year in your 401k. Let's get started.\n\n1. Start Early, Start Now\n\t1.  To truly reap the benefits of compound interest, you should start investing in a 401k as early as you can. In my early 20s, I believed that I am \"too young\" to start investing for retirement, so I acutally intentionally setup my 401k contributions to 0% so that I can have more take home pay. It's not until my early 30s, that I actually realized that I should be contributing to a 401k all along, and have been putting away as much as i can ever since.\n\t2. It is said, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is now\"? If like me, you haven't got started yet, there is no better time to start than now. Starting late means that you have to put away even more per month to reach your retirement goals. (start_investing_early.png)\n2. . Minimize your taxes\n\t1. By contributing to a 401k, you will pay lesser taxes to the government in any given year due to what is called a \"pre-tax deduction\". Let's look at an example of what that means. \n\t2. Lets say you make \\$100,000 in a year, and say you effectively pay  20% or \\$20,000 in taxes. Assuming you contributed 10% of your income to a 401k, or $10,000, that means 10% of your income is deducted from your income *before* taxes are calculated. Which means that you pay taxes on $100K-10K = $90K. At a 20% effective tax rate, you would be paying $18K in taxes instead of $20K without 401k contributions. So by contributing to a 401k, you've really made yourself $2K extra by not forking it over to the government.  \n\t3. In reality, your tax rate might be lower after you contribute to a 401k. Lets say you only pay 18% effective taxes, so you pay $16.2K in taxes. You have now saved $3.8K in taxes. And effectively, you are paying only 16.2K/100K = 16.2% effective tax rate instead of 20%. \n\t4. If you are fortunate to make enough, or live well below your means to sock away the maximum allowed contribution to a 401k, which is $22,500 in 2023, then this is the amount that you should contribute to get the maximum tax savings in any given year. \n\t5. If you are over the age of 50, you  get to contribute another $7500 as \"catch-up contributions\" for a maximum of $30,000\n3. Get your matching contributions\n\t1. Several employers match the 401k contributions of their employees up to a certain limit. For example, your employer might say that they match $1 for every $1 contributed up to 5% of your salary. \n\t2. So if you make $100,000, and contribute 10% (or $10K) to your 401k in the year, the company will match every dollar up to 5% of your salary, or $5K. In this example, you will get an extra $5K into your 401k contribution. \n\t3. In reality, many companies use a tiered system where they contribute lets say $1 for every $1 up to $3000, $0.5 for every $1 thereafter, which makes the calculation more complex, but in essense you still get more money into your 401k by getting the company match. \n\t4. What is more amazing about the company match is that it is not limited by the $22,500 401k limit mentioned earlier. The company's contributions will help you save more than the 401k limit. So if the company match was an extra $5K,  your annual contributions will go up to (22.5+5)=27.5K or (30+5)=35K if you're older than 50. Now, there is still another option that allows you to reach $66,000 in annual 401k contributions, stick around to find out.\n\t5. Should you not contribute to a 401k if you don't have a company match? No, the company match is just an added benefit. Contributing to a 401k still does save on taxes and is worth doing just for that sake. But if you do have a company match, at least contribute enough to get the free money!\n4. Save at least 10% of your income\n\t1. Fundamentally, the contribution rates comes down to how much you can afford to put away, and what your monthly expenses are. So it would be best to first examine how much money you need every month to cover your needs from mortgage or rent, to groceries, childcare, medical, or discretionary expenses. \n\t2. Even if you do enroll in a 401k but don't get around to actually setting the percentage deduction, your employer will most likely auto-deduct a default percentage from your paycheck and this is often in the range of 2%. This is a really good move in my opinion, because we will immediately start saving small amounts of money even if inertia gets the better of us and we don't get around to setting percentages in a 401k. \n\t3. If you do get around it, and if your monthy budget permits, it is generally recommended that you save at least 10% of your paycheck in a 401k. Obviously, the more the better, but that should be a good start.\n5. Enroll in Continuous Increase Program\n\t1. As time rolls on, you want to make sure that you increase the amount of money you save in a 401k. For this reason, many employers do provide a continuous increase program where you can set what % your 401k contribution should increase every year. A good idea here is to set it to annually increase 1-2%, so that in about 5 years you are now saving 15-20% of your paycheck and well on your way to financial freedom.\n6. Invest in Diversified, Low Cost Mutual Funds\n\t1. The simple and efficient option is to invest in target date funds. These are mutual funds that are generally well diversified, which means that they hold a broad spectrum of stocks and bonds so that you don't put all your eggs in one basket.  They also have a low expense ratio, which means that it costs you very little to buy and hold this fund till your retirement date. For example, if you decide to retire in 2060, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) is an excellent choice from Vanguard. It has returned over 8% on the average over the last 10 years, and it has an expense ratio of 0.08%, which means that you will not give up much of your investment returns in the form of fees. Simply buying and holding such a fund for a long time will ensure that you are underway to building a secure nest egg.\n\t2. Create your own 3-fund portfolio\n\t\t1. If you don't have access to a target date fund in your list of available choices in your 401k, you can create your own by buying the right mix of index funds in your 401k. Index funds hold a large number of individual stock holdings and gives you a diversified portfolio. For example, to emulate the 2060 retirement fund, you can simply buy 54% of a total stock market index fund, 36% of a total international index fund, and 10% of a total bond fund. This distribution of percentages is called an Asset Allocation. And, a good rule of thumb is to set your bond holdings to (Age-10) and allocate the rest to a mix of total and international stock funds. So if you are in your 20s, holding anywhere between 10-15% in bonds is a good choice.\n\t\t2.  Adding in variations with tilts and REITs\n\t\t\t1. If you want to get even more granular in your investment choices, you may choose to \"tilt\" your portfolio towards certain high risk, high reward choices. For example, you can choose to tilt towards smaller companies which provide more growth but at the cost of more fluctuations over time. In other words, it is more risky and volatile. You can choose to overweight your portfolio with a mutual fund like Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund (VSMAX) which focuses on smaller companies.\n\t\t\t2. Or you could choose to add some real estate investments in your portfolio by holding what are called REITS (or Real Estate Investment Trusts) which allows you to invest in mostly commercial real estate. Many people do choose to add REITs in their portfolio, because it is somewhat unrelated to stocks and can provide good balance and diversification in a portfolio. An example of a low cost REIT is Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX).\n7. Avoid Withdrawing from a 401k\n\t1. So now you've invested and grown your money for many years in a 401k. But when can you access it? According to IRS rules in 2023, you will be able to withdraw your money penalty free only when you are 59.5 years old. Pulling out your money any earlier than that will result in a 10% penalty for withdrawal, unless you satisfy the IRS exceptions to this rule. So if you are planning to retire earlier than 59.5, make sure that you have funds outside of your 401k, till you are old enough to withdraw penalty free from your 401k\n\t2. 401k loans\n\t\t1. Assuming withdrawal is not an option due to the penalties involved, but life circumstances require you to pull out some money for emergency expenses, you have the option to take a loan out of your 401k. This depends on your employer too, but typically you can pull out up to 50% of your savings up to $50,000 in a given year. You will have to pay that borrowed money back, with interest, within 5 years of taking the loan. You don't pay early withdrawal penalties this way, unless you default on your 401k loan, or quit your current employment in which case you will have to pay it back on a much shorter time frame.\n8. Invest in the after-tax 401k\n\t1. If you do have a really good source of income, the IRS does allow you to make what are called \"After-Tax 401k\" contributions up to $66,000 in 2023, which includes your original $22.5K traditional 401k and any company matching dollars. These contributions do not help you with reducing taxes like a traditional 401k, however.\n\t2. If there is no tax benefit, then why would you invest in this? The reason is that any earnings on after-tax 401k are not taxed till you actually withdraw from it, at which time you might be in a lower tax bracket. As they say, \"taxes deferred is taxes saved\"\n\t3. Some employers do allow you to convert after-tax contributions to a Roth 401k, which means that your earnings can grow and be distributed completely tax free!\n\t4. This can start getting complicated, so if you would like to know more about traditional, roth and after-tax 401ks, do let me know in the comments below for a future video.\n\nI hope you learned something new in this video.

The answer to that question will decide how you live your life\". I laughed, and replied, \"How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?\" Then he said, \"You're done for\". I ask him why. He then said, \"You will work till you die\".\n\nTo not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx\n\nI did belong to the non-saving group at one point in my life, and what held me back were the incorrect notions in my head about what saving and investing really was. Things like, I don't make enough, or I'm too young, I'll just start later. Investing itself seemed hard to me, with all its complex terminology and I thought it's a form a gambling, and a sure fire way to lose all my money. Now I know, these were misconceptions, and in this video I'm going to explain why and provide concrete steps for you to start saving today towards a secure financial future. Let's get started.\n\n---\n### Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save\n\nRonald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. So what you might ask? To that I will say,\n\n\"Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars\"\n\nTo get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. \n\nEach person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Here's a list of things you probably dont need, to get you started on thinking along those lines.\n- A new cell phone\n- All those TV subscriptions\n- Even the latest TV\n- A fancy car\n- An expensive vacation\n - A gym membership you don't use\n- Expensive clothing\n- Eating at fancy restaurants\n\nUse these savings to pay off credit card debt first. Seriously, do not have credit card debt. After that, even if you manage to save up $100 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck. Use a budgeting software if you have to, or write on a napkin, it doesn't matter, but find a way to know where your money is going. Personally, I just use a simple google spreadsheet to estimate my expenses, while breaking them down into major categories. I'm not particularly crazy about this to the last digit but at the end of the month, I track my expenses on a tool like Mint to make sure that I am relatively on track with what I've budgeted. At 3- or 6-month intervals, I like to check how much I have spent already, and then multiply that number to estimate how much my yearly spending will be. If you have a fairly regular income in any given year, you can also estimate what your projected savings rate for that year willl be, which takes us to...\n\n---\n### Misconception #2: I'm too young to start retirement savings\n\nLet's talk about another 92 year old, and he has not amassed $8 million, or $80 million. His net worth as it stands today is over $80 Billion, yes with a B. \n\nThe 'Oracle of Omaha', Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11, and made his first million by the age of 30. In fact over 70 Billion of his wealth came after he turned 60. That is the magic of compounding, because in his sixties, he already been in the stock market for half a century. \n\nLet's say that you have managed to find ways in your budget to save $100 per month. If you simply put that in a savings bank account paying 2%, you will have $13,000 dollars in 10 years, of which $1000 is interest earned. Instead if you invest that $100 in an S\u0026P 500 index fund,  whose historical rate of return has been 7%, your $100 monthly investment will grow to $16,000 in 10 years. In 20 years, it will be nearly $50,000 and in 30 years it will grow to about $110,000.\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that it is never too young to start investing. Rate of return on investment is largely not in our control, it varies depending on the stock market and interest rates. But the one thing we can actually control is our savings rate. The sooner you start to have a higher savings rate, the more your wealth will grow.\n\nSo how much should be saving? There is this simple rule of thirds that's easy to remember. Let's say that this loaf of bread is your monthly income. Let's say you pay a third in taxes, medicare, social security. That's money you'll never see again, at least for a while. You now have 2/3rds left. Use another third for your expenses, nourish yourself and your family, take affordable vacations, build memories instead of buying things.  And the final 1/3, you put away for another day. \n\nThe average savings rate in the US is about 7-8%, and saving a third of your gross income means you are saving about 4 times as much as the average saver, and would put you in the top 5% of all savers in America. \n\nUnderstandably this is a hard target to reach, but even if you save 10 cents for every dollar you spend, this will make you an above average saver for whom compounding will work its magic provided you start early.\n\nSo you've decided to start putting away money for a rainy day, but how do you invest it? This brings us to our next misconception.\n\n### Misconception #3: Investing in complicated\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/financial-literacy-resource-center-7151950\n\nThe thing about investing that scared me off the most is all the terminology that surrounds it, and the media hype that you need to be some sort of a genius with numbers to successfully invest. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you are starting out, you only need to think of 3 places to park your money.\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/thumb/7/75/Prioritizing_investments.svg/1000px-Prioritizing_investments.svg.png\n1.  The first place that you should be putting away money is in a savings account. You need to build a cash reserve for emergencies such as medical bills, repairs, or job loss. Banks give you a relatively low rate of return for a savings account, but that's okay. Some online banks or credit unions do provide a slightly higher rate of return. But It's not about maximizing your returns here. If you've worked through your monthly expenses, you will already know how much you spend in a month - let's say $3000. I typically try to keep at least 6 months of expenses, which would be $18,000 in a savings account for emergencies. This money is not invested into any risky assets, but held just in cash. Investing will come later.\n2. Once you have your savings in place, you should then contribute to a tax sheltered account such as a 401k and IRA. I made an in-depth video on this channel about investing in a 401k, so do check that out. I'll leave the link in the video description. Tax sheltering means that you will pay less in taxes, that means more money for you to use, so you should definitely be taking advantage of that. My employer allows me to invest in a 401k through Fidelity, and if you are not sure how to get started on your 401k, you should definitely reach out to the benefits department in your company to find out more.\n3. Once you've got the savings and tax-sheltered account taken care of, you can then open up a brokerage account. You can open an account at the same company you have your 401k in, for simplicity. I have my brokerage account at Vanguard personally, but there are a variety of companies you can choose from. Any extra money you manage to save can be put away in this account and invested for the future. This difference with this account is that, there is no tax advantage, but there is also no age limits on when your money is accessible. So if you're planning to retire early, you will need this account to grow so you can use this money in early retirement before you 401k becomes available to you. \n\nOnce you have money in an investing account, make sure that you don't leave the money sitting  around uninvested. A friend of mine left his contributions uninvested for 3 years because he didn't know where to begin. This is not uncommon, and the easiest way to get started is to buy a target date fund. This means that you figure out in what year you intend to retire, for example, the year you turn 65. And you buy a fund that is tailored to meet that retirement date. This all-in-one single fund purchase will meet all your needs at the most basic level, and get you out of analysis-paralysis and started in investing. Don't worry, you can always change your mind and switch into different funds later, but this is a great place to get started. The one reason why such a fund is a great choice is due to its low expense ratio - there's a term you have to learn about. It simply indicates how much it costs you to buy and hold the fund, and anything less that 0.5% is reasonably low-cost.\n\nIf you can get your savings going in just these three places, you will have a great start in your investing journey and you can always revisit this as you learn more. \n\nI pretty much got all my learning on how to invest from this really great website called bogleheads.org. No, not a bobblehead. That's different. Bogleheads are a group of investors who follow the investing advice of John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard. The basic philosophy is to keep it simple, invest early and often and stay on the investment course through market ups and downs. They have more detailed explanations on their wiki, along with a ton of great info from seasoned investors that I definitely recommend you check out. If you prefer reading a book, they also have a page on suggested readings, and I'd definitely recommend \"The Bogleheads' guide to investing\" as a starting point. It's an easy read and has a great wealth of information thats simple to understand. Finally, they have a great forum where you can ask questions and get feedback on how you're doing financially, and how you can do better. I'll leave a bunch of links in the description below that you can start off with.\n\nLet's move on to the last misconception.\n\n### Misconception #4: Investing is gambling\n\nWe all have a voice deep down that asks, \"What if I lose all my money? Am I gambling by investing?\" After all we regularly hear of financial scams, bank collapses and market crashes, and what if we are caught in the middle of it? In reality, the results of investing in any given time period is definitely uncertain. But there are two levers that we have in our control to maximize our chances of success. \n\n1.  asset allocation\n2.  time in the market\n\nAsset allocation is a fancy term that basically describes how your money is actually invested. You could choose to distribute your money between stocks, bonds, cash, or even real estate, and depending on how you split up your money between these options, your portfolio can be calculated to have a certain risk for the return you are getting. Usually, more risk, more reward. In order to choose an asset allocation, we need the second lever - \"time in the market\". How long can we keep our money invested? Someone in their 20s has an investment horizon of over 40 years and has a longer time frame in which they can recover from market downturns compared to someone who is retiring in 5 years. \n\nLet's take the example of the US stock market from 1872 to 2022. Let's look at the returns in terms of rolling periods. A rolling period is a window of time within which the average return of the stock market is calculated. Assume that Subbu invested $100 in the year 1980. Let's say that year the market returned 5%, so the 1 year rolling return would be 5%. Lets then say that in the next 4 years, the market returned 6% -4% 9% and -1% respectively. So the average return over 5 years is 3% up to 1985. We can make the same calculation in the period 1981-1986, 1982 and 1987, and so on- which are different rolling 5 year windows. Now that we understand this, let's look at more rolling windows.\n\nIn a one year rolling window,  you can see that there are many years where you would have lost money and the variation of how much the return rate varies is high as shown by the standard deviation of 18.2%. But looking at the 5 year rolling window, you can see that the standard deviation is lower, and there are fewer periods where you would have lost money. In the 10 year rolling window, there are even few periods of loss and lower standard deviation. In the 20 year window, there are no periods where you would have lost money in the market.\n\nshow this animation in video:\nhttps://themeasureofaplan.com/us-stock-market-returns-1870s-to-present/\n\nThe longer you stay invested, the more chances that you will not lose money investing. As a result, the younger investor can potentially own more risky assets, in expectation of a higher reward which is another reason for starting investing early. The younger you are, the more you can weather market storms. A commonly used yardstick is to have 100-your age in stocks, since it is typically a riskier asset than bonds or cash. So someone in their 20s can have 75-80% in stocks, and allocate the rest to bonds or cash. Also, be prepared to hold these stocks for decades regardless of the market ups and downs. Panic selling in market downturns will make those paper losses real, and significantly impact your return over the long run. Ask yourself, \"Am I prepared to see a loss of 50% in my stock portfolio and be ready to nothing about it?\". If the answer is no, dial down your exposure to stocks in your asset allocation. Pick a value that will help you sleep better at night. Hopefully this convinces you that investing does not have to be a gamble if you can buy a diversified asset and hold it for a long time. \n\nSo there you go - If you've never started investing, I hope this video has given you a starting point.

The answer to that question will decide how you live your life\". I laughed, and replied, \"How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?\" Then he said, \"You're done for\". I ask him why. He then said, \"You will work till you die\".\n\nTo not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx\n\nI did belong to the non-saving group at one point in my life, and what held me back were the incorrect notions in my head about what saving and investing really was. Things like, I don't make enough, or I'm too young, I'll just start later. Investing itself seemed hard to me, with all its complex terminology and I thought it's a form a gambling, and a sure fire way to lose all my money. Now I know, these were misconceptions, and in this video I'm going to explain why and provide concrete steps for you to start saving today towards a secure financial future. Let's get started.\n\n---\n### Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save\n\nRonald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. So what you might ask? To that I will say,\n\n\"Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars\"\n\nTo get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. \n\nEach person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Here's a list of things you probably dont need, to get you started on thinking along those lines.\n- A new cell phone\n- All those TV subscriptions\n- Even the latest TV\n- A fancy car\n- An expensive vacation\n - A gym membership you don't use\n- Expensive clothing\n- Eating at fancy restaurants\n\nUse these savings to pay off credit card debt first. Seriously, do not have credit card debt. After that, even if you manage to save up $100 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck. Use a budgeting software if you have to, or write on a napkin, it doesn't matter, but find a way to know where your money is going. Personally, I just use a simple google spreadsheet to estimate my expenses, while breaking them down into major categories. I'm not particularly crazy about this to the last digit but at the end of the month, I track my expenses on a tool like Mint to make sure that I am relatively on track with what I've budgeted. At 3- or 6-month intervals, I like to check how much I have spent already, and then multiply that number to estimate how much my yearly spending will be. If you have a fairly regular income in any given year, you can also estimate what your projected savings rate for that year willl be, which takes us to...\n\n---\n### Misconception #2: I'm too young to start retirement savings\n\nLet's talk about another 92 year old, and he has not amassed $8 million, or $80 million. His net worth as it stands today is over $80 Billion, yes with a B. \n\nThe 'Oracle of Omaha', Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11, and made his first million by the age of 30. In fact over 70 Billion of his wealth came after he turned 60. That is the magic of compounding, because in his sixties, he already been in the stock market for half a century. \n\nLet's say that you have managed to find ways in your budget to save $100 per month. If you simply put that in a savings bank account paying 2%, you will have $13,000 dollars in 10 years, of which $1000 is interest earned. Instead if you invest that $100 in an S\u0026P 500 index fund,  whose historical rate of return has been 7%, your $100 monthly investment will grow to $16,000 in 10 years. In 20 years, it will be nearly $50,000 and in 30 years it will grow to about $110,000.\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that it is never too young to start investing. Rate of return on investment is largely not in our control, it varies depending on the stock market and interest rates. But the one thing we can actually control is our savings rate. The sooner you start to have a higher savings rate, the more your wealth will grow.\n\nSo how much should be saving? There is this simple rule of thirds that's easy to remember. Let's say that this loaf of bread is your monthly income. Let's say you pay a third in taxes, medicare, social security. That's money you'll never see again, at least for a while. You now have 2/3rds left. Use another third for your expenses, nourish yourself and your family, take affordable vacations, build memories instead of buying things.  And the final 1/3, you put away for another day. \n\nThe average savings rate in the US is about 7-8%, and saving a third of your gross income means you are saving about 4 times as much as the average saver, and would put you in the top 5% of all savers in America. \n\nUnderstandably this is a hard target to reach, but even if you save 10 cents for every dollar you spend, this will make you an above average saver for whom compounding will work its magic provided you start early.\n\nSo you've decided to start putting away money for a rainy day, but how do you invest it? This brings us to our next misconception.\n\n### Misconception #3: Investing in complicated\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/financial-literacy-resource-center-7151950\n\nThe thing about investing that scared me off the most is all the terminology that surrounds it, and the media hype that you need to be some sort of a genius with numbers to successfully invest. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you are starting out, you only need to think of 3 places to park your money.\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/thumb/7/75/Prioritizing_investments.svg/1000px-Prioritizing_investments.svg.png\n1.  The first place that you should be putting away money is in a savings account. You need to build a cash reserve for emergencies such as medical bills, repairs, or job loss. If you've worked through your monthly expenses, you will already know how much you spend in a month - let's say $3000. I typically try to keep at least 6 months of expenses, which would be $18,000 in a savings account for emergencies. This money is not invested into any risky assets, but held just in cash. Investing will come later.\n2. Once you have your savings in place, you should then contribute to a tax sheltered account such as a 401k and IRA. I made an in-depth video on this channel about investing in a 401k, so do check that out. I'll leave the link in the video description. Tax sheltering means that you will pay less in taxes, that means more money for you to use, so you should definitely be taking advantage of that. My employer allows me to invest in a 401k through Fidelity, and if you are not sure how to get started on your 401k, you should definitely reach out to the benefits department in your company to find out more.\n3. Once you've got the savings and tax-sheltered account taken care of, you can then open up a brokerage account. You can open an account at the same company you have your 401k in, for simplicity. I have my brokerage account at Vanguard personally, but there are a variety of companies you can choose from. Any extra money you manage to save can be put away in this account and invested for the future. This difference with this account is that, there is no tax advantage, but there is also no age limits on when your money is accessible. So if you're planning to retire early, you will need this account to grow so you can use this money in early retirement before you 401k becomes available to you. \n\nOnce you have money in an investing account, make sure that you don't leave the money sitting  around uninvested. A friend of mine left his contributions uninvested for 3 years because he didn't know where to begin. This is not uncommon, and the easiest way to get started is to buy a target date fund. This means that you figure out in what year you intend to retire, for example, the year you turn 65. And you buy a fund that is tailored to meet that retirement date. This all-in-one single fund purchase will meet all your needs at the most basic level, and get you out of analysis-paralysis and started in investing. Don't worry, you can always change your mind and switch into different funds later, but this is a great place to get started. The one reason why such a fund is a great choice is due to its low expense ratio - there's a term you have to learn about. It simply indicates how much it costs you to buy and hold the fund, and anything less that 0.5% is reasonably low-cost.\n\nIf you can get your savings going in just these three places, you will have a great start in your investing journey and you can always revisit this as you learn more. \n\nI pretty much got all my learning on how to invest from this really great website called bogleheads.org. No, not a bobblehead. That's different. Bogleheads are a group of investors who follow the investing advice of John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard. The basic philosophy is to keep it simple, invest early and often and stay on the investment course through market ups and downs. They have more detailed explanations on their wiki, along with a ton of great info from seasoned investors that I definitely recommend you check out. If you prefer reading a book, they also have a page on suggested readings, and I'd definitely recommend \"The Bogleheads' guide to investing\" as a starting point. It's an easy read and has a great wealth of information thats simple to understand. Finally, they have a great forum where you can ask questions and get feedback on how you're doing financially, and how you can do better. I'll leave a bunch of links in the description below that you can start off with.\n\nLet's move on to the last misconception.\n\n### Misconception #4: Investing is gambling\n\nWe all have a voice deep down that asks, \"What if I lose all my money? Am I gambling by investing?\" After all we regularly hear of financial scams, bank collapses and market crashes, and what if we are caught in the middle of it? In reality, the results of investing in any given time period is definitely uncertain. But there are two levers that we have in our control to maximize our chances of success. \n\n1.  asset allocation\n2.  time in the market\n\nAsset allocation is a fancy term that basically describes how your money is actually invested. You could choose to distribute your money between stocks, bonds, cash, or even real estate, and depending on how you split up your money between these options, your portfolio can be calculated to have a certain risk for the return you are getting. Usually, more risk, more reward. In order to choose an asset allocation, we need the second lever - \"time in the market\". How long can we keep our money invested? Someone in their 20s has an investment horizon of over 40 years and has a longer time frame in which they can recover from market downturns compared to someone who is retiring in 5 years. \n\nLet's take the example of the US stock market from 1872 to 2022. Let's look at the returns in terms of rolling periods. A rolling period is a window of time within which the average return of the stock market is calculated. Assume that Subbu invested $100 in the year 1980. Let's say that year the market returned 5%, so the 1 year rolling return would be 5%. Lets then say that in the next 4 years, the market returned 6% -4% 9% and -1% respectively. So the average return over 5 years is 3% up to 1985. We can make the same calculation in the period 1981-1986, 1982 and 1987, and so on- which are different rolling 5 year windows. Now that we understand this, let's look at more rolling windows.\n\nIn a one year rolling window,  you can see that there are many years where you would have lost money and the variation of how much the return rate varies is high as shown by the standard deviation of 18.2%. But looking at the 5 year rolling window, you can see that the standard deviation is lower, and there are fewer periods where you would have lost money. In the 10 year rolling window, there are even few periods of loss and lower standard deviation. In the 20 year window, there are no periods where you would have lost money in the market.\n\nshow this animation in video:\nhttps://themeasureofaplan.com/us-stock-market-returns-1870s-to-present/\n\nThe longer you stay invested, the more chances that you will not lose money investing. As a result, the younger investor can potentially own more risky assets, in expectation of a higher reward which is another reason for starting investing early. The younger you are, the more you can weather market storms. A commonly used yardstick is to have 100-your age in stocks, since it is typically a riskier asset than bonds or cash. So someone in their 20s can have 75-80% in stocks, and allocate the rest to bonds or cash. Also, be prepared to hold these stocks for decades regardless of the market ups and downs. Panic selling in market downturns will make those paper losses real, and significantly impact your return over the long run. Ask yourself, \"Am I prepared to see a loss of 50% in my stock portfolio and be ready to nothing about it?\". If the answer is no, dial down your exposure to stocks in your asset allocation. Pick a value that will help you sleep better at night. Hopefully this convinces you that investing does not have to be a gamble if you can buy a diversified asset and hold it for a long time. \n\nSo there you go - If you've never started investing, I hope this video has given you a starting point.

The one common thing we all have is the length of a day - 24 hours. It's how we deploy that precious resource that determines how we will live our life.\n\n_2 years earlier_\n\nMy typical day used to look something like this. Wake up at 7am. Get a cup of coffee and check social media, read the news and browse the web. It's 8am. Change in to work wear and get to work by 9am. Work from 9am to 5pm. Am I productive for all 9 work hours? Not at all- but we'll get back to this later. Get home at 6pm. watch some TV till 7pm to \"relax\", rustle up some food, watch some more TV while eating. At 9pm, open up my work laptop to check some emails, get sucked into work and spend the next hour or so answering emails and trying to work on \"quick stuff\". My brain now has lit up like a christmas tree, so I lie in bed with my phone looking at instagram reels and youtube videos to calm it down, and before I know it, it's midnight. If I'm lucky I'll fall asleep within the hour - leaving me only 6 hours to sleep. _maybe I can play: \"everyday is exactly the same\" by Nine Inch Nails during this part (license permitting)_\n\nWhat I was doing wrong was making work the central part of my life, and not being intentional with the rest of my day, which I spent on auto-pilot, letting social media, news and TV command my time, leaving me little time to exercise, read or work on any hobbies I wanted to. My engineering work at my employer was also not intentional. A lot of my day went into what Cal Newport calls \"shallow work\", like answering emails and IM's, and not planning exactly what I wanted to get done in the day. I was not making every hour very productive.\n\nIt was time I made some changes, and this is what I did.\n\n_present day_\n\nI asked myself, what is the most important aspects of my life I want to address in my day. \n\n\n##### Intention and Mindfulness\nThe first thing I experimented with is - being intentional with silence. Often the temptation is to listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks while doing work - whether it is knowledge work or just chores at home. I found that this was filling up what Chris Bailey calls \"Attentional Space\" in his book \"Hyperfocus\". Your attentional space is what you can pay at most attention to, at any given time. Whatever you are working on, let's say takes up 80% of your attentional space, the temptation is to fill the remaining 20% with something like music. What I have found is that leaving the 20% unfilled results in a lot less mental fatigue when you have some wiggle room in your attentional space. It's rather unsurprising that it is exhausting to run my mental CPU cores at maximum capacity all the time. By running my mental cores at moderate capacity helps me work for longer periods of time with greater focus, and I'm less tired at the end.\n\nIt's not like I never listen to a podcast when I am working on something. I do. But I try to make sure that what I am doing occupies relatively little attentional space. Habitual things like folding laundry, doing dishes or vacuuming usually takes little focus from the mind. At these times, I have plenty of attentional space to listen to a podcast or audiobook, and I do so if I feel like it.\n\nWhen I started leaving some attentional space free and not filling it with a distraction, something interesting happened. I started to notice a lot more - the mouse clicks while I'm working, the sound of water when I'm cleaning, sounds of food cooking. It was a natural symphony that would otherwise be blocked out by the audiobook I'm listening to. It had a naturally soothing effect on my mind. I think the right word for this is mindfulness. Being mindful about what I'm doing had a way of stopping me from trying to get things done as fast as I could. I started to let things take the time they need. I was doing things I needed to get done, but without the accompanying stress.\n\nBy slowing down and doing one thing at a time, I will not listen to all the podcasts or audiobooks that I wanted to. And that's fine. I figured that I don't have to rush to consume all the content that is out there. This helped me be more picky about what I will actually listen to, and that's a good thing. Intentional silence goes a long way in making a peaceful mind.\n\n##### Reframing expectations\nMy second major mindshift came when I asked my older child a question: \"The floor is full of markers, paper and toys. Does it not bother you?\" Then I proceeded to say - \"It bothers me because the floor is where I walk, and now I'm not able to very well\". His answer was - \" I don't have a big enough table to work on, so this floor space is my workspace.\" \n\n\n### Ending\n\n## Shotlist\n| Section | Text | Shot | Shot Type | Music | Sounds | Status |\n| ------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |\n| text    | text | text | text      | text  | text   | ‚úÖ     |\n\n## Editing Checklist\n- [ ] Color Correction\n- [ ] Color Grading\n\n## Publishing Checklist\n- [ ] Upload video to YouTube\n- [ ] Add thumbnail\n- [ ] Add title\n- [ ] Add description\n\t- [ ] Explain what the video is about\n\t- [ ] Create timestamps\n\t- [ ] Include any links needed\n- [ ] Add tags\n- [ ] Add end cards\n- [ ] Add video cards\n- [ ] Activate monetization\n- [ ] Watch video for errors\n- [ ] Schedule video for publish\n- [ ] Add video to playlist\n\n## Post publishing checklist\n- [ ] Make instagram post\n\t- [ ] Add tags\n\t- [ ] Add link to bio\n- [ ] Make twitter post\n- [ ] Update this document's yaml frontmatter\n- [ ] Add URL below\n\n## Video URL üéâ\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.097509567Z","tags":null},"/projects/youtube/Ways-to-swap-money-for-time":{"title":"Ways to swap money for time","content":"\nMoney compounds when invested properly but time is a continuously depleted resource.

I told myself that I am not that busy or that entitled to clean up after myself, then I convinced myself that no cleaning service can match my OCD-infused levels of ultra-cleanliness\n\t- As it turns out none of this is true. I finally came around to admitting that I needed the help given that we have children and two full time jobs, and that cleaners are super professional at what they do and generally do a good job. I realized that I am just being a control freak over this whole cleaning matter. It dawned on me that, not only do I spend the time cleaning, I spend time recovering energy from my cleaning work. It was time to hire someone to clean - but how much does it really cost?\n\t- House cleaning services typically run 20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. You can get quotes from cleaning companies in your area. If you've never got your housed professionally cleaned before, they might insist that you get a deep cleaning first -  which can run you about 300-400. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty and how much you want to spend on the service. Or, you can even get just deep cleanings done once in a few months, where things like blinds, fans and refridgerators get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about 200-500 depending on the size of your house.\n\t- This might be too expensive for some people, that's totally understandable. In that case, get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won't weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. \n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Running the vacuum cleaner around the house\n\t\t- Wiping a countertop\n\t\t- Dusting some surfaces with a mask on.\n- Home and car maintenance\n\t- If you're one of those people who absolutely love to do-it-yourself, and derive happiness from it, hey, good on you, you're going to save a lot of money, and have a good time while doing so! \n\t- However, if home and car upkeep is not your jam, then you're gonna have to pay your way out of it. When it comes to home maintenance, some things can cost an arm and a leg (and your firstborn -- just kidding), and some stuff is relatively inexpensive, so let's go through some of them.\n\t\t- Lawn care -- this is going to cost you like 50-100 bucks per mow depending on your lot size, and where you live in the united states, but if you dont enjoy doing this yourself, its fairly simple to have someone to come in to take care of it.\n\t\t- Pest control -- this one costs about 100 / visit and it is probably sufficient to have some one come to take a look every couple of months or so, and I don't believe anyone particularly loves dealing with pests, so forking out some cash may be worth your while\n\t\t- Plumbing -- I have a simple rule. If I can't unblock a drain by snaking it, call a plumber. I am fairly dumb when it comes to plumbing and things get messy real quick, so i'd rather have some one come over. It's hard to give a cost estimate because the quote to fix will depend on how extensive your plumbing issues are. So I'll just leave that with a (shrug)\n\t\t- Car care -- I always get tire rotations and oil changes done at a local garage, because it is much easier to do when the car is on a hoist. And I don't want to be responsible for proper disposal of engine oil. Technically, brake pads are rather easy to do yourself, but getting a professional to do it gives you the peace of mind that the car is still safe to drive.\n\t\t- Apart from this, there is a whole lot out there like tree removal, plumbing, electrical, fences, windown cleaning, roofing, HVAC, gutter cleaning... which is too much for this video\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Walking through tall grass\n\t\t- Enjoying short cut grass\n\t\t- Pulling weeds, trimming hedges\n- Laundry Service\n\t- If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for. How it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.\n\t- The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you. \n\t- If you have a washer and dryer at home, then you can run loads whenever possible, and couple folding with something like watching TV and make it a family effort to knock it out of the park. At home, when I get the kids involved in folding and putting away their clothes, stuff goes super quickly. So I've never had the need for a laundry service, but hey everyone's needs are different and your milage may vary!\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Carrying laundry basket\n\t\t- Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials\n\t\t- Folding clothes, putting on hangars\nBy the way, if you're enjoying this video, do click the little hitchhiking sign down below, and consider subscribing. Thanks!\n- Cooking\n\t- This is something we have to do for the rest of our lives, so it's worth figuring this out. Eating out, while making the healthiest food choices can definitely save you time, good quality food, even if readily available around you, can be very expensive over the long term. I do have friends who say that the overhead of buying groceries, preparing food, dealing with the ensuing kitchen clean up, etc, is simply not for them, and argue that the expense of eating out is totally worth it.\n\t- An alternative to eating out all the time is to have pre-prepared meal kits delivered at your doorstep, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to prepare your meals. There are companies such as Hello Fresh, or Fresh n Lean that ship to your door step, and you get a variety of diet choices like vegan, paleo, or keto. The cost per serving is typically between $10-$20, and while this calculus might work out for some people, it is simply not an option for those with larger families, in my humble opinion.\n\t- Another option is to get Pre-prepared meals from places like Costco or similar grocery stores, where you get a pizza that you simply pop in the oven, or meals that you can quickly cook in the microwave in a few minutes. The preparation time is much lesser, and you can quickly put some food on the table. Cost-wise this is more affordable than all the previous options, and might be a decent option for those with families.\n\t- The final option is to prepare all your meals yourself from scratch, and is the most cost effective and healthy but most time consuming. However, you can save time by setting aside a day on the weekend to food prep for the entire week. It can be a great time to bond with family. Save time by reusing pots and pans, cleaning as you go and cooking for multiple days while the oven is hot. When food is ready, pack them into lunch boxes and stow them away in the fridge.\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Cutting vegetables and meat\n\t\t- Lighting a stovetop\n\t\t- Stirring food\n\t\t- Cutting bread\n- Commute\n\t- As of 2019, Americans spend about 27.6 mins each way in their commute on average, and about 10% spend an hour or more. Minimizing commute time can make a significant improvement in your quality of life, and get you back a big portion of your day.\n\t- But to minimize your work commute, you will need to live closer to your workplace, and depending on your industry and location, this might actually end up costing you more in mortgage or rent. The cost can be controlled by choosing a smaller or less fancy place to live, but this is a real tradeoff we have to make. The silver lining is that you will pay lesser in transportation costs, may even eliminate the need to own a car, or simply be able to use public transportation.\n\t- If you are lucky enough to have the option for remote work, then none of this applies - so let's move on to the next one.\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Getting in car and driving away\n\t\t- Pulling up into driveway and getting out\n\t\t- Fast forward video of driving through traffic\n- Child care\n\t- I've got to say up front that time spent with your child is priceless, and is something you can never outsource. However, every so often we could all use a little extra help around the house so that you can actually spend quality, uninterrupted time with your child and be there for them at the age they need you most. For this, you can actually hire what is called a Mothers helper. So care.com (not sponsoring this video) has an article that describes what a mothers helper does .\n\t\t- Do dishes while you play with the kids\n\t\t- Run some errands\n\t\t- Play with older children, while moms tend to the younger child\n\t\t- Help decorate the house, or wrap gifts\n\t\t- Help with homework\n\t- Typically mothers helpers are \"baby sitters in training\" - so that they can help watch kids while the parents are around. They are typically less expensive overall than hiring a full time nanny. But since I only learned of mothers helpers more recently, and my kids are much older now, I've never had the chance to actually hire them. If you did, leave your experience in the comments below. That would greatly help out- thanks.\n\t- \n\nTo summarize, here are the six services that allow you to buy back your time so that you can deploy it in the most meaningful ways in your life. \n\n\n\nFood:\nhttps://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-prepared-meal-delivery-service/","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.097509567Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/2023-03-04-The-Bottoms-Up-Approach-To-Writing-That-99-Guarantees-A-Successful-Article":{"title":"","content":"\n# The Bottom‚Äôs Up Approach To Writing That 99% Guarantees A Successful Article\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672)\n[Read Original](https://evchapman.medium.com/the-bottoms-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-successful-article-a2efd7132f0a)\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e Most writers have two problems that stop them from creating consistent content. They either sit staring at a blank page wondering what to write. Or they put so much effort into one piece of content but really have no idea if it will resonate or not with their audience.\nBut writers who take a bottom‚Äôs up approach to content creation discover:\nTheir ideas are clarified further the more they write about them.\nThey never start from a blank page because ideas get promoted upwards from tweets to essays to articles and beyond.\nThey always have a good idea of what resonates because ideas have already been tested down the ladder.\nTheir content creation feels effortless because each level builds on the next and the positive signal provides motivation to keep creating.

If you already have an idea it‚Äôs not hard to get it to that next step of 250 words.\nThey are easily consumable. You‚Äôre not asking people to leave the platforms (which Twitter hates) and they can be consumed in mostly less than a minute [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#44f0c1bc-f545-46a2-82fd-2175dc1af2cf)\n\n\u003e I‚Äôve found leaving about a 2-week gap between the original tweet and a follow-up essay creates the best results. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#a3c61902-d518-4a5e-9cc6-233862c0f211)\n\n\u003e Step 3: Turn Your Best Essays Into Articles [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#cab81780-0ee3-4f88-8f70-c4323e548e73)\n\n\u003e It takes me far less time to write an article because:\nIt‚Äôs already half-written with an outline from the essay.\nI‚Äôve articulated it previously in a tweet \u0026amp; an essay so I‚Äôm getting clear on the idea.\nI have feedback in the form of Twitter comments which helps me expand on the idea even more.

Did your manager tell you about the project, or did you kick it off with a team? Was the project hand-delivered to you as an assignment, or was it something you figured out?\nWhat was your first interaction with the project, and how did you feel going into it? Were you intimated or excited? Eager or annoyed? Why?\nWhat was the first thing you did? Not the first thing the team did, but what did you do once you learned about the project? Did you schedule meetings with stakeholders, look through past research, write down everything you knew about the work to come, or something else?\nWhat was the first (or second) challenge you encountered? How did you feel? What did you do to work through the challenge with others?\nHow did the project typically progress? Did you need to rally the team together regularly, were regular meetings booked by a product manager for you, or did you set up consistent design critiques for the team to give you feedback? Did you do research, and if so, who scheduled it? How did all of that work feel for you?\nWere there any notable challenges you faced during the project? Call these out! Was there a disagreement between you and someone else? Was there a time you dropped something or failed to meet expectations? How did you recover from those things?\nWhere did the project end up? What, if anything, would you have done differently?

You should think about what you have read, draw connections to other readings, and truly make it your own. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#3c5d4c14-f603-48d5-bd21-4176f884abbb)\n\n\u003e Not all books are worth large efforts.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#9a52fd13-5cd9-4c73-9d6f-32f3da7a6bc2)\n\n\u003e The Barbell Method takes this into account by integrating your reading habit into your knowledge work with two steps:Read the book. Read swiftly but don‚Äôt skip any parts unless they make you vomit or put you to sleep. Mark all the passages that stand out and contain useful, interesting or inspiring information.\nRead the book a second time. But now you read the marked parts only. This time you make notes, connect them to past notes (Zettelkasten Method!) and think about what you‚Äôve read. Make mindmaps, drawings, bullet points ‚Äì everything that helps you to think more clearly. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#b40f87c6-361b-429e-9a3c-35bbf6f2cc1e)\n\n\u003e The quality of the book will now determine how much time you invest in it.

That is a shallow kind of processing that suffices to understand what is easy to understand. You are probing the text and can later decide what you should do with it. You decide on a part-by-part basis.\nA text consists of four different types of parts:\nUseful and difficult to understand. You want to process these parts heavily for understanding and exploitation. Mark these for later.\nUseful and easy to understand. You want to process these parts heavily for exploitation. Mark these for later.\nNot useful but difficult to understand. You actually don‚Äôt want to process these parts but you don‚Äôt know if they are useful. Sharpen your mental theeth with them and then ignore them after you found out that they are not useful.\nNot useful and easy to understand. Ignore these.

To write about what you read is important even if you don‚Äôt aim to write books on something. Still, you have to write if you want to think properly. Still, you have to write to process information properly.

There are as many reasons to fear as there are grains of sand on a beach.\n* there‚Äôs a simple trick to get over the initial hump: keep doing the thing until you feel numb.\n* In the case of Commonplace‚Äôs newsletter, it became ‚Äòanother thing I write on Tuesdays‚Äô. Ditto for blog writing, and podcasting, and public speaking.\n* The corollary to this idea is that you can only get good at something if you‚Äôre past the numb stage.\n* Or, to put this differently: focus on getting numb first. Then focus on getting good.\n* don‚Äôt seek feedback. If people offer you advice, shut it out. It‚Äôs not that feedback is bad, or that advice is terrible, it‚Äôs that none of it is useful until you‚Äôre numb.\n* whenever a friend asks me for advice on blogging, I tell them to just publish a post a week. I try not to give them advice about blog topics or writing techniques,\n* when you‚Äôre getting your kid started in sports, do what is necessary to get them numb before you focus on improving their technique.\n* When managing a content marketing team, get your podcast host to produce episodes at a weekly cadence before iterating for marketing impact.\n* if aforementioned new podcast host/producer is willing to share her work on her personal social media accounts, then she‚Äôs likely numb enough or proud enough of her work to be able to iterate effectively. It's only then that I can switch to more aggressive feedback. But not before.\n* Radio producer Ira Glass has a famous quote where he says:\n* All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.‚Äù\n* Get numb, then get good.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.097509567Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/How-Food-Powers-Your-Body":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories](url)\n* Author: James Somers\n* Publisher: The New Yorker\n* Published Date: 2022-10-25\n* Tags: \n\n## Highlights\n* Szent-Gy√∂rgyi is often credited with saying that life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest;\n* Glucose is like a chemical shipping container. It is an ideal electron transporter, in part because it is high-capacity, conveniently shaped, and easily opened up. It‚Äôs also unusually soluble, which means that it travels well through the bloodstream.\n* Our brains, whose parts have especially unpredictable energy requirements‚Äîas neurons fire, they create spikes in demand‚Äîdepend almost exclusively on glucose for energy.\n* When glucose reaches our cells, it is‚Äîunlike a shipping container‚Äîdismantled systematically. A series of reactions strips its highest-energy electrons and uses them to form a small ‚Äúcarrier molecule‚Äù known as an NADH. If glucose is like a shipping container, then NADHs are like delivery trucks. The process of loading the electrons into the trucks is called glycolysis.\n* When glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen, it is known as fermentation. If your muscles are pushed to their limit and there‚Äôs not enough oxygen in your bloodstream, your cells ferment glucose as a stopgap measure for energy production.\n* Oxygen is so hungry for electrons‚Äîits outer shell needs only two more to get a complete set‚Äîthat in effect it pulls them all the way through the Krebs cycle, which is the real powerhouse of our metabolism.\n* energy-rich electrons are peeled off and loaded up onto yet more NADHs‚Äîfar more than in glycolysis alone.\n* mitochondria‚Äîstructures believed to have descended from a free-floating bacterium that was ingested by one of our ancestors long ago and co√∂pted.\n* A mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which create a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane like rabbits poking their heads through a hedge. These proteins capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n* At the moment that the protein pulls each electron inward, it also disgorges the proton, pushing it from the internal chamber to the external one. This extrusion happens everywhere across the membrane. The result is that many positively charged protons build up outside, separated by a wall from the negatively charged electrons held inside. An electrical field comes into being. Quite literally, each mitochondrion becomes a battery, waiting to discharge.\n* The electrical field generated by the process, he explains, has a strength of around thirty million volts per metre‚Äî‚Äúequivalent to a bolt of lightning across every square nanometre of membrane.‚Äù\n* Pulled by the electrical current, they desperately want to get back to the inside of the mitochondrion, where the electrons are. Their only way back, however, is to squeeze through tiny mushroom-shaped conduits that litter the membrane. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are actually little turbines. Seen in minute detail through electron microscopes, they resemble waterwheels; the protons turn them as they pass.\n* each turn of the wheel assembles a molecule of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP‚Äîthe energy currency of our cells.\n* By dint of its structure, ATP is extremely willing to give up its energy, but it is prevented from doing so by a few precisely controllable molecular speed bumps‚Äîlike\n* each molecule of ATP is endowed with a standard amount of energy, created by the physical motion of a molecular gear. ATP is used in every kind of cell, where it‚Äôs converted into kinetic, chemical, or electrical energy.\n* Metabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n* The Warburg effect describes the peculiar fact that cancer cells tend to behave as if they‚Äôre in a metabolic emergency. When normal cells are short on oxygen, the mitochondrial turbines slow; anaerobic glycolysis, or fermentation, takes over. What‚Äôs strange is that cancer cells do this even when oxygen is abundant. The Warburg effect is considered almost universal across cancers; one relatively common sign of a tumor‚Äôs presence is a buildup of lactate, caused by the cancer cells fermenting. It‚Äôs unclear whether this fermentation is a cause or consequence of the disease. Do cancer cells ferment because they are growing out of control‚Äîor is fermentation driving the growth?\n* He argues that it might explain the outsized correlation between cancer and aging.\n* A popular hypothesis holds that the root cause of this mounting risk is the accumulation of genetic mutations.\n* rate of accumulation isn‚Äôt nearly fast enough to explain the extraordinary trajectory that cancer risk takes over a lifetime.\n* As you age, your mitochondria accumulate wear and tear. Often, the cause is inflammation‚Äîwhether from disease, injury, or periods of stress. Inflammation itself becomes chronic with age, for reasons that are still not entirely understood.\n* Meanwhile, a process known as mitophagy, in which old mitochondria are eaten by the body so that new ones can grow in their place, slows down. The result of all this is that our mitochondria get tired, and do a slightly worse job.\n* The conditions grow ripe for cancer: mitochondrial waste products start to pile up, as at a broken assembly line; perhaps, if it gets bad enough, a cell might believe that the backup is due to a lack of oxygen.\n* In that mode, when glucose arrives, the priority becomes stripping it not for its high-energy electrons but for molecular building blocks. The cell reverts to one of its earliest programs, active during embryonic development, in which the prime directive is not to work but to grow.\n* The impression I got from ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù was that the Krebs cycle was the key not just to life and its origins but to aging, cancer, and death. More likely it is just a part of all those things.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-15T14:19:55.097509567Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/How-To-Cultivate-Attention-In-Our-Distracted-World":{"title":"","content":"\n# How To Cultivate Attention In Our Distracted World\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-cultivate-attention-in-our-distracted-world-1874aafe2b7)\n[Read Original](https://amugofinsights.substack.com/p/how-to-cultivate-attention-in-our?r=222kot)\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e Kierkegaard lived like a hermit and only allowed himself to speak to someone during his ‚Äúpeople baths‚Äù. Michel de Montaigne liked the company of classical authors in his stone tower better than the quacking mobs in town. And even someone like Theodore Roosevelt, who was naturally gregarious and outgoing, disappeared into the library for long periods before he resumed his social life at Harvard. These long periods of attention and isolation were not eccentric quirks but indispensable to these thinkers.

After nearly a decade of this kind of learning, we‚Äôve domesticated ourselves into ‚Äúanswer-finding machines‚Äù instead of curious thinkers. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-cultivate-attention-in-our-distracted-world-1874aafe2b7#42acaf24-3a2c-45ed-a6f2-8bb1daa20816)\n\n\u003e with all the information available through our phones  constantly supplying us with answers, there‚Äôs virtually no room to think for ourselves.

People read newspapers on the train, at caf√©s and in front of stores.

Le Journal, for Flaubert, promoted a new kind of stupidity he called: La B√™tise. The idiot, with the power of mass media on his side, can get to the cutting edge of science, literature and philosophy, but he is still an idiot. He knows a lot without understanding because he never bothered to engage knowledge with sustained attention.

In friendships, for example, attention allows us to put aside our prejudice and face a person as they are. In politics, attention lets us observe events with distance and judgements instead of leaping to our first impulse to get into a shouting match. In our personal lives, deliberate practices like meditation free us from the chaos of our minds. To put it simply, attention is the act of being human and a defence of ethics.

The model describes drain current overshoots induced when turning on the transistor gate and suggests a novel extraction method for the recombination lifetime in the silicon film.‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1198](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY))\n\n[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1198\u0026annotation=GF3Q3W3B)‚ÄúThe experiment consists in maintaining the SOI MOSFET back gate grounded, whereas the front gate is switched from depletion or accumulation regime to strong inversion (Fig. 1). The minority carriers needed in the inversion channel are rapidly supplied by the heavy doped source/drain regions. The positive pulse on the front gate leads to the depletion region extension, but in the case of a PD SOI film, the majority carriers expelled from this region cannot be removed instantaneously and are stored in the neutral body. This induces a temporary increase in the body potential, , which lowers the threshold voltage and results in excess drain current (Fig. 1). Equilibrium is reached through carrier recombination for removing the excess majority carriers.‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1198](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) This describes the physical reasons why drain current overshoots and how recombination effects bring it back to steady state\n\n [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1199\u0026annotation=ZRNFEIB7)  \n([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1199](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) Figure shows show the depletion region widens when a positive pulse is applied at the gate.
