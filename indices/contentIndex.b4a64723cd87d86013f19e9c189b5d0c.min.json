{"/":{"title":"Vik's Notes","content":"\nHello! üëãüèΩ Welcome to my online notes repository, which is my attempt to do my thinking and learning on a global stage, and hopefully interact with some fine human beings along the way!\n\nA lot of the content will dynamically change as my perspectives evolve, but that is the point of it. You'll see unfinished work, blatant mistakes, complete misunderstandings, and hopefully something that you will like and use in your own thinking. So like everything on the internet, take what you will with a pinch of salt.\n\nHere's what I am up to [[now]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:46:54.409532147Z","tags":null},"/now":{"title":"now","content":"\n- üì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices\n- üéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [[https://www.halflife.show | Half Life Show]]\n- ‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my tech blog [[https://rfic.io]].\n\n## Managing time\n\nI try not to get too focused on utilizing every moment of my waking life to any useful purpose. Fulfilling work and family responsibilities is the highest priority, and everything else follows.\n\nI do not use to-do lists. I much prefer daily highlights.\n\n## Health\n\nOver the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based food when possible. Stretching in the evenings is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.\n\n## Music\n\nI play in the community rock band at [[https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock|Villa Musica]]. I was a former lead guitarist for [[https://www.reverbnation.com/fused |FUSED]]. I was a founding member of [[https://blackearth.in|Black Earth]]. I've been focusing on alternative and sweep picking techniques to add flurry to my metal lead playing. [[https://www.jonbjorkmusic.com|Jon Bjork]] has some reallly good tips, and I took lessons for a while with [[https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall|Straten Marshall]].\n\n## Self-hosting\n\nI host my own cloud storage with [[https://nextcloud.com|Nextcloud]] and my google photos alternative is [[https://photoprism.app|Photoprism]]. I have a home server whose specs I'll list out at some point, but it's fairly simple and low powered. I host a whole host of other services too, but maybe more on that later.\n\n*Last update: Dec 16, 2022*","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:46:54.409532147Z","tags":null}}
