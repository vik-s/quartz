{"/":{"title":"Vik's Notes","content":"\nHello! üëãüèΩ Welcome to my online notes repository, which is my attempt to do my thinking and learning on a global stage, and hopefully interact with some fine human beings along the way!\n\nA lot of the content will dynamically change as my perspectives evolve, but hopefully you will see something that you will like and use in your own thinking. Like everything on the internet, take what you will with a pinch of salt.\n\nHere's what I am up to [[blog/_now|now]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-17T04:18:26.346545167Z","tags":null},"/blog/_now":{"title":"Now","content":"\nüì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices\n\nüéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [Half Life Show](https://www.halflife.show)\n\n‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my [tech blog](https://rfic.io)\n\n## Health\n\nOver the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based foods when possible. Stretching is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.\n\n## Music\n\nI play in the community rock band at [Villa Musica](https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock). I was a former lead guitarist for [FUSED](https://www.reverbnation.com/fused). I was a founding member of [Black Earth](https://blackearth.in). I've been focusing on alternative and sweep picking techniques to add flurry to my metal lead playing. [Jon Bjork](https://www.jonbjorkmusic.com) has some reallly good tips, and I took lessons for a while with [Straten Marshall](https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall).\n\n## Self-hosting\n\nI host my own cloud storage with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) and my google photos alternative is [Photoprism](https://photoprism.app). I have a home server whose specs I'll list out at some point, but it's fairly simple and low powered. I host a slew of other services too, but maybe more on that later.\n\n## Books\n\n[Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-David-Goggins-audiobook/dp/B07KKP62FW) by David Goggins has had an immense impact on how I think about myself, and what I am capable of. Embracing the hard things in life has definitely had a positive impact on my life. A more detailed reading list is [[here]].\n\n## Podcast list\n\nI am a fairly heavy podcast listener. Here is my current rotation.\n\n### General\n- [All-in podcast](https://www.allinpodcast.co)- Absolutely hilarious discussion of current events and business from industry titans.\n- [Lex Fridman podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/)-Long form discussions with a variety of guests.\n- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex)-Discussion between two people about handling their lives.\n\n### Health\n- [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com)-Science-based tools for health and wellness.\n- [The Drive](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/)-Sometimes has good guests on, but paywalled episode releases are mildly annoying.\n- [Found my fitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes)-Can get in-depth for casual listening but usually has good interviews.\n\n### Tech\n- [Self-hosted show](https://selfhosted.show)-Running your own servers\n- [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com)-Updates on the world of linux\n- [Coder Radio](https://coder.show)-About the software industry\n\n\n*Last update: Dec 16, 2022*","lastmodified":"2022-12-17T04:18:26.346545167Z","tags":null}}
