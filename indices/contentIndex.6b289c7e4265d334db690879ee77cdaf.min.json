Instead of creating annual resolutions, which are oft bound to fail due to their rigid nature, a yearly theme is a broad framework that is intended to guide my actions towards my goals.\n\n## Looking back at 2022 themes\n\nIn 2022, I chose two themes to guide me: **Health** and **Music**. I talk about this in my [podcast](https://www.halflife.show/7) in greater depth. I want to reflect on how that worked out for a minute.\n\nIn terms of health, I started resistance training three times a week and that has helped drop my body fat percentange by about 3%. I'm not going to extol the benefits of having lean muscle mass in this article, but it is key to proper hormone regulation and metabolic health. \n\nTo build muscle, I have been targeting about 1g of protein intake per pound of body weight, per day. It has been hard to keep up, unless I include a significant amount of meat in my diet, which I cannot always do for various reasons. I've prioritized sleep over everything else in the evenings, targeting 7+ hours of consistent shut-eye everyday. These health themed lifestyle changes have greatly improved by mood, energy and cognition throughout the day.\n\nMusic has been much harder for me to keep up with consistently. I was not able to adhere to a strict practice schedule, but I did become more concious about improving my technique when I did actually play guitar, instead of noodling away my time. I took a month's worth of lessons with [Straten Marshall](https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall/), and he pointed out that my alternate picking suffered because my hands were not synchronized. It seems obvious in hindsight, but working on that specifically has helped a lot. My alternate picking has gotten a lot cleaner and faster as a result. I have included playing scales and modes in my practice routine. These are boring, but necessary.\n\nPlaying music with others has been a challege, due to time contraints of everybody involved. I have considered [[permanent/using zettelkasten for music composition|an alternate approach]] to music composition based on a [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician|blog article]] I read, but I'll have to see how that works out in practice. I have joined a community rock band to play music with other people, but that has not proved to be challenging or instructive thus far.\n\n## Now, not later\n\nThis is my yearly theme for 2023. As of this writing, I'm about halfway reading [[literature/B-Burkeman-2021|4000 weeks by Oliver Burkeman]], and while I disagree with a lot of his views, I do accept that ==time is finite==. We have about 4000 weeks to live. Too often, I end up delaying things to another time, or working towards a better future without enjoying the now. This is the now. This is it. I'm here. And I've already spent about 2000 weeks of my life.\n\nTo apply this theme, I'm going to have to keep in mind a few key concepts:\n\n1. I have to restrict the number of things I actually pursue. For example, I cannot learn a new programming language, and contribute to open-source projects. Why? Because I am already running a podcast, have a family with young kids, play music, and like to read and write, while having a full time job. This leaves few hours to much else. It's time to accept that.\n2. I have to be fully present in the now and learn to quickly slip into a flow state at whatever I am doing, whether it be office work, music, playing with kids or doing the dishes. No multi-tasking. Minimal distraction.\n3. No more productivity hacks. No hourly planning, to-do lists, pomodoro timers, or overly complex workflows. Daily highlights are okay to keep a focus on what needs to get done. Go through the day giving each task the attention it deserves - no more, no less, and see where things land. Pick up what falls to the wayside at another time.\n4. Apply the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) whenever possible. Be aware that the last 20% of any task takes 80% of the time (that I don't already have.) Be happy with the 80%, while knowing that perfection is admirable but costly.\n5. This one is cheesy, but true. Live everyday like it is your last. This might be the last time I ever did something. Pick up my child, visit Las Vegas, or go surfing. Enjoy and savor every moment because I might never get it again.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIt is necessary to slow down the conveyor belt of tasks that appear in life, and my yearly theme is designed to do that. This does not mean I abandon my previous years' themes entirely when the new one arrives. I will still work on my health and music. I view it as a continuous evolution of myself. I absorb each years theme till it becomes a part of me. This is the only way we can all become better versions of ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.293694002Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allblog":{"title":"All Blog Posts","content":"\n2022-12-19: [[blog/Yearly Themes 2023|Yearly Themes 2023]]\n2022-12-31: [[blog/2022 in Review|2022 in Review]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.293694002Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allpodcast":{"title":"All Podcast Notes","content":"\n[[literature/P-Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health|Huberman Lab Podcast: Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.293694002Z","tags":null},"/blog/_now":{"title":"Now","content":"\nüì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices\n\nüéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [Half Life Show](https://www.halflife.show)\n\n‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my [tech blog](https://rfic.io)\n\n## Health\n\nOver the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based foods when possible. Stretching is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.\n\n## Music\n\nI play in the community rock band at [Villa Musica](https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock). I was a former lead guitarist for [FUSED](https://www.reverbnation.com/fused). I was a founding member of [Black Earth](https://blackearth.in). I've been focusing on alternative and sweep picking techniques to add flurry to my metal lead playing.

I host a slew of other services too, but maybe more on that later.\n\n## Books\n\n[Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-David-Goggins-audiobook/dp/B07KKP62FW) by David Goggins has had an immense impact on how I think about myself, and what I am capable of.

Regions like the brain have unusual and rather erratic energy needs. The body exclusively relies on glucose for energy.\n\n[[permanent/Glucose is the fundamental means of transporting energy to various parts of the body]] because it is unusally insoluable and can travel well through the blood stream. Think about it as an ideal electron shipping container.\n\n### What is Glycolysis?\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis is the breaking down of a glucose molecule]]\n\nWhen glucose reaches the destination cell, the highest energy electrons are stripped and used to construct a carrier module known as NADH  (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide + Hydrogen, or coenzyme 1), in a process called glycolysis. It is the breaking down of glucose (glyco = glucose, lysis = break down).\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis in the absence of oxygen]]\nWhen glycolysis happens in the absense of oxygen, it is known as fermentation and it produces lactate. This is a stop gap measure for energy production when it is really needed quickly, like during exercise when muscles are pushed to their limit.\n\n### What is Krebs Cycle?\n\n\n### What is mitochondria and how do they work in the body?\n\n[[permanent/Mitochondria and their structure]]\nThey are structures believed to have descended from free-floating bacterium that our ancestors injected a long time ago. They do not share the same DNA make-up as humans, but instead they have their own DNA, and co-exist with humans to enable life as we know it.\n\nA mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which creates a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane to capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n\n[[permanent/Mechanism of generation of ATP by mitochondria]]\nWhen an electron is pulled into its internal chamber of the mitochondrion, a proton is expelled to the outer chamber. An electric field is built up between the inner and outer chamber. Each mitochondrion is like an electric battery waiting to discharge. The electric field strength is about 30 million V/m. Its like lightning in a bottle.\n\nThe proton is subject to an electric field and wants to get back into the inner chamber where the electric fields are. The only way through is to pass through small conduits shaped like mushrooms. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are like little turbines and the protons turn them as the pass through it. Each turn of the turbine assembles a molecule of Adenosine TriPhosphate, or ATP, which is the fundamental energy currency of the body. It is converted into kinetic, chemical or electrical energy by the body.\n\n\u003eMetabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n\n\\- James Somers\n\nAs you age, inflammation from a variety of causes such as disease, injury, diet, and stress causes mitochondrial wear and tear. Even just aging seems to cause mitochondria to wear, and that is not yet entirely understood. Old mitochondria are eaten by the body by a process called [[Mitophagy]], and new ones take its place. Aging slows down the replacement rate of mitochondria eventually.\n\n### The Warburg effect\n\n[[permanent/The Warburg Effect is a phenomenon where cancerous cells behave as if they are in a metabolic emergency]], like  during heavy exercise, where there is a shortage of oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis takes over in the cancer cells even when there is plenty of oxygen, and the cells start to ferment building up lactate. This happens universally among all cancers, and the presense of lactate is a common sign of a tumor's presence.\n\n### Link between mitochondrial, aging and cancer\n\nDue to mitochondrial wear and tear, waste products from the mitochondria start to pile up, and the body believes that this is due to a lack of oxygen. It then begins anerobic glycolysis and the cells start to ferment with the buildup of lactate. When glucose arrives, the cell does not strip away high frequency electrons as usual, but instead starts up the process for building more cells, which is one of its earliest directives during embryonic development. As a result, cancerous cells grow in the presence of fermenting cells and lactate, and is a possible explanation of the Warburg effect.\n\n----\n# References\n\n- [[read-it-later/How Food Powers Your Body]]\n- https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/A-Turning-music-into-a-chore-is-how-I-became-a-musician":{"title":"Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThe author of this article explains that by treating music making like a routine job that you do everyday, and putting in the time day after day without worrying about how good the output is, you can become really productive and consistent in making music, and produce high quality work.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Put in sheer time to get better at your craft, watch videos, learn how things are done.\n- Make music everyday, or on a repeatable set pattern. It's not something that depends on whether you feel like it or not.\n- Create a list of \"chores\" that is required to finish a piece of music. Do it everyday. Things to think about:\n\t- Steps to take a song from nothing to finish\n\t- Methods of music storage and retrieval for composition\n\t- Techniques to arrange the music into sections, how will you deal with bpm issues?\n\t- How will you control performance quality? Will you replay the tracks?\n\t- How will you remember how to play it? Will you figure it out again?\n\t- What is the plan for lyric writing (again something to practice everyday)? And how will you sing it? Pick a style that suits your voice- Like OSI.\n\t- What about the production phase, Mixing and Mastering?\n\t- Can you use AI-art (Stable diffusion) to generate album covers?\n\t- What is your method of distribution?\n- Never judge a piece of music when you just created it. File it away, you might love it later.\n- Make music boring. Get numb before you get good.\n\nThis follows the same principle that I've heard [[Misha Mansoor]] from [[Periphery]] talk about. He made tons of songs under the name of [[Bulb]]. He mentions too that he kept at it, till he got better at composing music.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#cb6a981d-781e-4296-8b72-11189c3d6d28)\n\n\u003e German sociologist Georg Simmel rightly called metropolitan life an intensification of nervous stimulation. For the brain not to lose its marbles against this intensity, people must make rapid decisions with their heads instead of their hearts. As Simmel wrote beautifully in the paper Metropolis and Mental Life: \n‚ÄúThe reaction to metropolitan phenomena is shifted to that organ which is least sensitive and quite remote from the depth of the personality.‚Äù [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#d0ce5f0d-c2a9-4371-867f-2b13910acd57)\n\n\u003e There‚Äôs no heart in the metropolis, only a bunch of floating heads calculating their next moves. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#be88731d-b55f-4aef-8e3a-72bc7b53c983)\n\n\u003e A direct consequence of this metropolitan over-stimulation is something called the blas√© attitude. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#1cad3060-791d-4d52-9a01-c0b933e9f729)\n\n\u003e Simmel considered the blas√© attitude a byproduct of overstimulation from metropolitan life. A million things are happening in the city, and all the stimulations tend to ‚Äúagitate the nerves to their strongest reactivity for such a long time that they finally cease to react at all.‚Äù When we spend enough time in the city, we will reach a point where we‚Äôd stop caring about anything. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#1a3fe0f1-262c-422b-8140-844b37904d3c)\n\n\u003e And by trying our best to act deliberately against the chaotic currents, we may secure a patch of peace in our hyper-productive culture. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#9feda5db-ab47-4a78-b4bd-ce2a767ff6ef)\n\n\u003e So go to a park, visit your aunt in the suburbs or meditate for five minutes in the morning. The enemy isn‚Äôt the rude city folks. Instead, it‚Äôs the undercurrent of our unsustainable pace that makes us so intolerable to one another.

Obsidian already has that.\n\n## Chapter 4: Few things to keep in mind\n\n\u003e A tool is only as good as your ability to work with them.\n\\- Sonke Ahrens\n\nIt is important to understand what the slip-box system is, and how to use it, but also you should know *why* it works, so that you can tweak the tool to your needs.\n\n\n# Four underlying principles\n\n## Chapter 5: Writing is the only thing that matters\n\n\u003e An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.\n\nWriting is the only thing that counts in learning, research or studying. It *is* learning, research or study. Often in schools, writing is described as a separate activity done at the end of the research program. The typical sequence of learning/research is:  \"Brainstorm\" a research idea, read papers about it, do the necessary research, come to conclusions, and write a paper. But this is not true; writing helps during every stage of the research evolution.\n\n#### What are the advantages of writing while learning?\n- You will feel more engaged\n- You will learn to differentiate good ideas from one that only sound good\n- Your reading will be more engaged because you have to connect the note to ideas in your note collection by writing them in your own words\n- Much more likely to remember\n- You will do everything more deliberately\n\n## Chapter 6: Simplicity  is paramount\n\nThe old way of note taking is really what I been doing all my life- underline something in a book, write something in a margin, or write my thoughts on a sheet of paper to file away by topic. But this has never really worked. I forget where I put the note, how to get it back, and sometimes that I even wrote the note. There is no use in taking such notes in the first place. \n\nTake proper notes instead. So what is needed from this new system?\n\nA low threshold for taking notes, a process of elaborating your own thoughts on them in a day or two, and a way of storing such thoughts and interlinking them.\n\nOld system asks- Where do I store this note?\nNew system asks- In what context will I stumble on it again?\n\nOld system is a top down approach where you have to know where this \"belongs\" even before you developed insight. As your notes grow, it gets messier.\nNew system is a bottom up approach where your insights develop as the notes increases. It gets more orderly rather than messy.\n\nBut the slip box system can get messy too, if you add notes indiscriminately, without paying attention to their quality and the connections they make with your other notes. This is something to pay attention to.\n\nWhen it comes to taking notes, you must clearly distinguish between 3 kinds:\n1. Fleeting-  only to capture your notes, to be thrown away later.\n2. Permanent- well written notes in your own words that are never thrown away, but you will make connections to other such notes, and will eventually lead to insight. It has to be elabored on so that it will make sense on its own, without the context it was taken from.\n3. project- only needed when working on a project. Can be thrown away later. Examples of such notes are outlines, writing snippets, reminders, to-do lists, draft papers, etc.\n\n[[permanent/Common pitfalls in note taking methods]]:\n1. You treat every thought as though it were a permanent note. This dilutes the quality of actual good notes, and creates a mess.\n2. You take project specific notes. You decide what you want to write about, then work on collecting all the relevant info, and create notes for the project. This means that you have to start the process over for every project. Any other idea that is not relevant to the project will end up being discarded. This is a great loss to development of insight because at that moment you will not know what is important and what is not, and therefore discard valuable ideas.\n3. You treat every note as a fleeting note. You write ideas down on a scratch paper, and these pile up when you dont process them in any way, and soon you will forget their context and significance.\n\n## Chapter 7: Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch\n\nEvery academic writing book tells you that you should first decide what the topic you are going to work on is going to be, then collect and read all the relevant material, make notes (usually ends up as highlights and in the margins), and then write a report. \n\nThere are several downsides to this approach:\n1. You have picked the topic without knowing much about it at all\n\t1. No insight has been developed yet\n\t2. You might realize that this topic does not interest you. This results in being demotivated to work\n2. You face a blank screen or a blank paper when you are about to write\n3. You resort to *brainstorming* which is a very unreliable way to retrieve information from our brains that usually cannot store detailed information for very long\n\nThe main point here is that your writing starts long before you actually need to produce a report. You learn by writing, while you read a particular topic. You are always driven and motivated because you are following your interests and insight to see where it takes you, instead of working towards an ill-informed topic right from the start. When it is time to produce written material, it is simply a matter of arranging already written notes and filling in the gaps. \n\n## Chapter 8: Let the work carry you forward\n\nHaving ways of consistently and frequently receiving feedback on your work will provide a positive experience that will enable you to quickly get better at what you are learning. This quickly creates a positive spiral where we start to enjoy the work we do, work more and then get even better at the subject, and further enjoy our work! This way, the work carries you forward. This is no involvement of willpower or planning here. This related to [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]]. This concept should somehow apply to [[Music]] and instrument playing too. The better you get, the better you sound, and therefore more likely to play longer, ensuring a positive spiral.\n\nThe slip-box note taking system gives you the constant feedback you need to stay motivated by providing us with contradictions, connections and inconsistencies in relation to other notes in the slip box. This enables us to pursue further lines of thought to resolve these differences we see in the slip box. In addition, expressing writing in your own words really gives you feedback on whether you have fully understood the concept you are addressing. This will cement your learning much more reliably and enable you to get better even quicker.\n\n- [ ] Write about the growth Mindset\n\n\n# Six Steps to successful writing\n\n## Chapter 9: Separate and Interlocking tasks\n\n1. Each task should get undivided attention. No multitasking.\n2. Each writing task needs a different kind of attention (proof, critic, author, outlining). Everything requires a different perspective to get the job done. \n3. During reading, every kind of text needs a different kind of attention too.\n4. Do not follow prescribed or planning methods and strategies from other people to create your work; become an expert by spending time on it, making mistakes and developing experience that allows you to go by intuition.\n5. Break up the process of creation in smaller and more specific tasks and work on them to completion. Write down thoughts that arise along the way, and process them later. Our short term memory is limited.\n6. Have a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] that enables you to focus only on the creating aspect, and not on the workflow itself. You will be able to minimize [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]], and switch tasks easily without losing thoughts. \n\nIt is interesting that a lot of these steps are what is described in [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician]]\n\nAhrens goes into a quick tangent about creativity that is interesting. It has been found that the most creative minds in science or art have both kinds of attention: wide-open and playful, and narrow analytical frame. This *flexibility* is essential to creativity. I was just thinking how various kinds are attention are needed to compose a piece of music: think of the song structure is different from composing a solo.\n\n## Chapter 10: Read for Understanding\n\nAlways read with a pen in hand so that you can write down in your own words the meaning of the text you are reading. How detailed the literature notes are depends on the nature  of the text and how detailed it is. Sometimes you will need to write a lot of notes for a book, and sometimes you can simply write down a few sentences to summarize a book. The important thing is to write down permanent notes while finding ways in which the ideas from the book fit in your slipbox. You have to reflect on the book about what it tries to convey, what practices were used, what assumptions were made, etc. It is as much as what is *not* written that what *is* written. The read end-goal is to create permanent notes. Dont make taking literature notes a project in iteself.\n\nConfirmation bias is one of the biggest dangers in research where we seek out only what we agree with. Read with an open mind, and collect ideas indiscriminately in your slipbox whether you agree with them or not. You only purpose is to make connections to other permanent notes. This will help create new insight and avenues for thought, and will result in much better work that addresses pros and cons.\n\nPractice extracting the gist of the idea when you are reading. Express it in a concise and clear way, and be very selective. Thinking beyond the text and applying it in a different context is vital to clear understanding.\n\nThe process of creating notes tests your understanding of the text by explaining it to your future self. Re-reading a text only gives an illusion of understanding because of confirmation bias. Writing it down trying to teach your future self is the only way to understanding and learning. Test yourself.\n\nThe most successful method of learning is elaboration, which involves thinking, writing and connecting to other pieces of already known information. It may take time to do so, but without it reading a book is a waste of time because there is no learning for the long term.\n\n## Chapter 11: Take Smart Notes\n\nA reasonable measure of productivity in a day is the number of notes added to the slip box. \n\nIn 11.2, Ahrens gives an example of how he read a book, and then developed personal notes out of it. It is good for the reader to have a clear example of how this slip box system works. In my opinion, this should have been presented much earlier in the book instead of waiting for Chapter  11!\n\nThere are two steps to elaboration: \n1. Think deeply enough about what you are reading\n2. Think about the meaning in other contexts than the text\n\nMake sure your note can be found later, by including them in an index or making sure it can connect form an index.\nBuild a \"Latticework of Mental Models\"\n\n## Chapter 12: Develop Ideas\n\nDont worry about gaps in the notes as it relates to concepts. If it helps you think better, write down the gaps in the thought process as a note as well. Most gaps in the argument will only become clear when you take out notes from the slip box to create a draft\n\nDont link too many notes from an index, just one or two. The interlinks between notes are much more important because being surprised by connections between notes is important later on.\n\nIf you want to write an article from a bunch of notes, create a new note with links to them. This can be temporary and subject to change as the topic develops. If the topic deviates significantly from your initial conception of the article, you can even create another note different from the first one.\n\nWhen creating notes, think of what keywords you might assign to it. Just one or two that puts it in a context different from where you got the note from. This is not the same as creating tags (that is more for note sorting in Obsidian). Look for unlinked mentions in Obsidian for possible suggestions to where you can link to other contexts. \n\nIf a topic has accumulated a significant number of notes on a topic, you might need a note that forms an index with links to about 25 notes with short descriptions of each. You will know when you need such a note. This note can then be linked to from the main index.\n\nAdding ideas to slip box leads to refinements, contradictions and corrections to old ideas, and overcomes the feature-positive effect, where we give more importance to more recent information even if its not the most relevant. Slip box enables us to access long forgotten ideas.\n\n\u003e You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head\n\u003e \\-Charlie Munger\n\nA slip box is a space where ideas can mingle freely so that you can come up with new ones.\n\nThe key to creative problem solving is the abstraction of ideas into more general context. This is something that a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] should support.\n\nOur brain is wired to jump to conclusions on what we are reading. Only upon revisiting, rethinking and revising our notes on the text can we truly understand or interpret in a different way. This is being \"open-minded\" with ourselves, knowing that our own interpretation can change.\n\nCreativity can have its roots from simple ideas pieced together to form something complex. This reminds me of a multilevel perceptron in machine learning.\n\nRestriction and structure are an essential crucible in which creativity is forged.\n\n## Chapter 13: Share your insight\n\nWriting with a zettelkasten system is simple:\n1. Look at your notes and see where the keywords cluster. That determines your topic.\n2. Gather all relevent notes and piece together an outline\n3. Identify missing arguments and work on filling them\n4. Forget about the slip box and narrow focus on getting the writing done\n5. Work on mutiple writing projects concurrantly, switching between them as often as you like\n6. Never fear to cut text from your drafts, and re-write as many times as needed.\n\nBeing intimately famiiliar with the slip box system enables you to internalize the ideas in it through elaboration. Your mind becomes more open and receptive to new lines of thought, fostering creative work.\n\n\n## Chapter 14: Make it a habit\n\nMake it a habit to read with a pen and paper in hand.\n\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.

When he spotted Feynman‚Äôs notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such ‚Äúwonderful records of Feynman‚Äôs thinking.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù Feynman protested. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the historian said, ‚Äúthe work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not a record, not really. It‚Äôs working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.‚Äù\n‚Äù\n\n## Survivorship bias in airplane bullet holes\n‚Äúwe can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us. \n\nOne of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn‚Äôt make it back. The RAF fell for a common error in thinking called survivorship bias (Taleb 2005). The other planes didn‚Äôt make it back because they were hit where they should have had extra protection, like the fuel tank. The returning planes could only\nshow what was less relevant.‚Äù\n\n\n## Hemingway and rewriting drafts\n‚ÄúErnest Hemingway was once asked how often he rewrote his first draft. \nHis answer: ‚ÄúIt depends. I rewrote the ending of ‚ÄòA Farewell to Arms,‚Äô the last page of it, thirty-nine times before I was satisfied.‚Äù \n‚ÄúWas there some technical problem there?

This book is about facing our finitude and making choices to pick and choose activities that give us most happiness and satisfaction in our limited time. Reader should be aware that this book often dabbles in existential nihilism hinting that our life is so short that it is basically devoid of meaning. Instead, the takeaway really here is that time is our most valuable resource and we should treat it as such.\n\n## Who should read this book?\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed with the number of things piling up in your to-do list, fueled by your commitment to work, family and hobbies that you derive satisfaction, this book gives some perspectives on how we can pick and choose things that we will get most happiness from. If you have trouble saying no, this book will help you identify that making hard choices is required to make use of our finite time. I would assume that this book is directed at at-least 30 somethings who have reached a point in their career and family where the number of obligations is too much to meet. \n\n## Tools to embrace our finitude\n\n- Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity\n\t- Use dual to-do list approach:\n\t\t- A \"current\" one limited to 10 entries. Only by finishing tasks, can you make way for more.\n\t\t- An \"open\" one that you put all your tasks into, knowing full well that some of them may never be finished.\n\t- Another apporach is to use a fixed time approach to establish the boundaries of daily work.\n- Serialize\n\t- Only focus on a big project at a time and see it to completion before moving on to the next.\n- Decide in advance what to fail at\n\t- There are great benefits to strategic underachievement. You can identify beforehard what you intend to do poorly at, and that will make way for you to succeed in the important things. You can also take a cyclical approach to failing, where you decide that you will not do something or do it poorly for the next few months.\n- Make a Completed list\n\t- Instead of always looking to a to-do list, start a completed list and only list tasks you have completed on it. This will avoid the anxiety of seeing all the tasks yet to be finished and derive satisfaction from your successes.\n- Consolidate your caring\n\t- If you are donating time to charity, political causes or activism, make sure you limit yourself to a few tasks.\n- Embrace single purpose technology\n\t- Pen and paper is often effective for note taking\n\t- When not reading physical books, kindle has minimal distractions compared to iPads\n- Seek out novelty in the mundane\n\t- Enjoy what you are doing instead of seeking out new pleasures. Absorb the now, and you will fill out time a lot longer. Go on walks, play with a child, meditate. Draw attention to the present.\n- Become a better listener\n\t- Relationships will be strengthened if you pay more attention to the other person speaking. Ask questions and adopt a mentality of curiousity, and show that you genuinely care about others.\n- Become spontaneous\n\t- If you think of calling a friend, do it right away. If you want to donate money, dont put it off until too much later.\n- Practice doing nothing\n\t- Just doing nothing enables you to feel the sensations and time flowing around you. Be present in it and stop trying to constantly manipulate your present experience.\n\n## Chapter Notes\n### Introduction: In the long run, we're all dead\n\n* We have 4000 weeks to live. Thats very short in the grand scheme of things. This book is about facing that fact, and accepting that we will never get everything done\n* Productivity has become: how do we cram most number of tasks into as little time as possible\n* We all regret \"wasting\" time when we are either too busy (no time to do what I want) or when having too much time (what should i have really been doing with my time?), because we are aware that time is limited.\n* Contrast life to a conveyor belt:\n\t* Tasks keep coming and we are supposed to get it done\n\t* We use productivity tools and shave time off each task\n\t* This causes conveyor below to move faster -\u003e more tasks\n- John Maynard Keene predicted that we will have 15 hour work weeks soon. He was wrong. We work more than ever now\n- Busyness has become a symbol of prestige, which is strange because the goal of getting rich is to not work as hard.\n* We yearn to spend time in more meaningful ways:\n\t* desire to devote to larger cause\n\t* having day job to cover what you really want to do\n\n### 1: The limit embracing life\n\n- We need new ideas about how to think about the limited time we have and how we use it.\n- Each hour of life is a container on the conveyor belt of life that we feel we have to fill with something\n- Before timetables were existed, people were mostly task-oriented. Do the task when it is necessary, no scheduling\n- This gives rise to a sense of timelessness that Richard Rohr calls living in deep time. We get this sensation when we see big landscapes where we lose ourselves for a moment.\n- We have started treating time as a resource, and feel like we dont have enough or wasting too much. Trying to make better use of time, we push ourselves harder even when there is no need to. It never feels like you do well enough.\n- Accept reality: time is short, you will never do all you want. Be guided by the time it inherently takes to do something, called *Eigenzeit* in German. Resist the need to do everything, and let time be your guide.\n\n### 2: The Efficiency Trap\n\n- What is it?\n\t\t- We believe we can get more efficient at doing our tasks and then \"make time\" for the things that really matter.\n\t- Parkinson's law will ensure that work always baloons to fill the time available.\n\t- Hard choices should be made: you have to give up something to make time for something else.\n\t- Instead of getting things done, you will add more things to do\n- You will not get it all done; just focus on the ones that count\n- Existential overwhelm: You want the get all of life experiences and push yourself to do so. Life has infinite experiences to offer, you can't have all of them. Enjoy the tiny slices of experiences you actually do have\n- If the goal is to clear your to-do list, you will end up doing the meaningless small tasks first instead of the important ones. So accept the fact that your to-do list will always have things on it, just prioritize better on the important things\n- By using convenience tools to eradicate life's seemingly tedious tasks, you often remove meaning and connection from your life.\n\n### 3: Facing Finitude\n\n- The early part of this chapter focuses on the fact that life will ultimately end; momento mori- remember that you will die. This might serve as a reminder to people who live very fast paced lives without stopping to think.\n- It usually happens that you face a moment of clarity when faced with finitude, like death or a terminal illness. We should not wait until that moment to realize that time is our most valuable asset.\n\n### 4: Become a better procrastinator\n- learn to neglect the right things, or the *art of creative neglect*.\n\t- Pay yourself first when it comes to time.\n\t\t- Use your primetime hours to do what is most important to you\n\t\t- If you are waiting to start a creative project, a social cause or anything that matters to you, at a later date, \"when you have the time\", dont. Start today, however small.\n\t\t- Protect time by scheduling meetings with yourself\n\t- Limit your number of concurrent projects\n\t\t- Do not work on more than 3 concurrent projects at once. If you need to add more, remove one from the list first.\n\t\t- Feel free to abandon a project if it isnt working out\n\t\t- Limit the number of half-finished projects\n\t\t- Define your projects in managable chunks, and work on actively finishing them. Something like \"get better at music\" is too broad. Pick a song you want to learn. This would avoid the project from clogging up the system when something more interesting comes along\n\t- Learn to say no to projects you *do* want to do\n\t\t- There will be many projects that you will want to do\n\t\t- Learn to actively say no to them. This is the way to focus on your priorities\n- We fear committing to a single path in projects or relationships. We have the fear of missing out on possibilities that could have been. We live out a perfect fantasy in our heads, and escape when reality does not meet that perfect expectation. A fine example is Franz Kafka's relationship with his fiance Felice Bauer.\n- You must settle on something, in order to strive to get better at it. You have to commit to an instrument you want to play, for example. Switching all the time will scatter your efforts needlessly.\n- I disagree with Burkeman that one should have a child to \"settle\" and find happiness. Yes, children are great, but its a responsibiliy that not all are cut out or want to begin with.\n- Once you make a choice to settle on something, anxiety falls away and now you can move forward with purpose\n\n### 5: The watermelon problem\n- People spent 40 mins watching a TV show where people were putting rubber bands on a watermelon till it burst. This seeming utter waste of time, seems a much better source of entertainment than how we spend our time \"doomscrolling\" on social media.\n- What you apply your attention to, is what dictates how you spend your life energy. Social media is a machine designed to collect your attention reserves for profit, and most people give away too much of their attention (life energy) to social media without realizing it. \n\n### 6: The intimate interruptor\n- Why do we so readily get distracted from hard tasks (like our job, or reading, or pracitisng an instrument)? We are the ones that distract ourselves ultimately.  Burkeman suggests that this is because of our awareness of finitude.\n\t- I disagree with this dramatic explanation of a fact that is much better explained with how social media is designed to deliver instant dopamine hits which the mind starts to crave. Most tasks worth doing do not give instant gratificaation. Finitude has nothing to do with it. It's a weak explanation attempting to shoehorn this observation into the theme of this book.\n- Burkeman suggests that there is nothing we can do to avoid distracting ourselves all the time. That aall techniques such as focus music, meditation, etc are pointless.\n\t- I disagree with this because it has been shown that binaural beats increase focus, and meditation has far reaching impacts on the body and mind even if done only for 17 minutes a day (heard from Huberman lab podcast). Again, the author paints a hopeless picture that we are supposed to accept.\n- We distract ourselves from our work, because we know what we can achieve is finite and limited. We can build in our imagination a perfect world, but reality usually falls short and we avoid facing this reality.\n\n### 7: We never really have time\n- Douglas Hofstadter jokingly said- Any task will take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law. For example, the sydney opera house took 14 years instead of the planned 4 years.\n- In trying to plan everything ahead of time to perfection, so that you will be able to avoid an outcome you do not want, you often cause more anxiety to yourself instead of facing the actual consequencies would cause themselves.\n- We strive to control our time and refuse to accept our limitations. By trying to shape our future by controlling time today, which leads to anxiety. A simple cure to this anxiety is to realize that we will never be able to fully ensure our future outcomes\n- Uncertainity has brought us this far in life. We handled it once, and will surely handle it in the future. Learn to accept future outcomes even if it is not the ideal one you imagined.\n\n### 8: You are here\n- *Instrumentalizing time*: Using time as a means to achieve something in the future. This is a problem we all face.\n- Abandon the future-chasing mentality of \"when-i-finally\" to do something. There is no fixed task list that you can complete that will result in an overnight state of happiness.\n- Children are a great example of being in the present. Their purpose is to be a child. They dont worry about kindergarden, grade school, high school, college, etc. This kind of future chasing mentality comes from the parent.\n- Life is just a series of moments that you have to experience now. Being absent in the present and working towards a future benefit means that you will miss life itself.\n\n### 9: Rediscovering Rest\n\n- We have even taking the pleasure out of leisure by:\n\t- Pressurizing ourselves to extract the most out of our holiday time\n\t- Use our time off to get things done and be \"productive\"\n\t- Using leisure as a means to be more productive later\n- True leisure according to Aristotle is self-reflection and philisophical contemplation, and is the highest of virtues.\n- Medival peasants worked only for 150 days a year, but the industrial age meant that workers need to be in factories, and were allowed to do what they pleased with their time off as long as it didnt interrupt profits.\n- Todays concept of rest is only a means to recuperate from work, and be more productive when going back to it, or to improve ourselves for a future benefit. Anything that does not fit into this framework is viewed as wasteful.\n- To truly enjoy rest, you have to accept that this is it, and that you cannot work yourself towards a state of perfect happiness. Real rest, where we do nothing can feel uncomfortable at first, but that is a sign that you are doing it right.\n- It is worth undertaking 'atelic' activities, what are things you do for the sake of doing them alone, like hiking.\n\n### 10: The Impatience Spiral\n\n- We suffer from chronic impatience, where we honk at others for no reason, don't wait for the microwave timer to run out, inch towards cars at red lights, etc.\n- Technology has made things fast for us, but we still strive to go faster. Food reheats in a minute, but we would rather it took zero seconds. This impatience has led us to experience \"restlessness\" when we pick up a book to read, because reading is something that cannot be rushed. We are constantly submitting to interruptions, and using it as an excuse to avoid the discomfort that comes with something that takes time.\n- Working faster has become an addiction, where we believe that we need to work as hard and as fast as possible to survive, leading to anxiety, which only makes us work more. This phenomenon is celebrated society as being \"driven\"\n- Surrender to the reality that things will take the time they take. Reframe your perspective to relish the hard things in life that take time.\n\n### 11: Stay on the Bus\n\n- To be successful at the hard things, \"stay on the bus\". Stick with it longer than others can and will, while having the patience to face failure and imperfection and you will be successful after sufficient effort has been put into your endeavor.\n- Not being in control results in discomfort and we shy away from situations where patience and acceptance of the lack of control would be the better choice. Example, fixing an unknown problem, listening to your partner carefully, working on a difficult creative problem.\n- Three principles of patience:\n\t- Develop a taste for having problems. Learn to love them.\n\t- Embrace radical incrementalism. Be consistent in getting a little better everyday. The results will be staggering. Don't be impatient for dramatic results.\n\t\t- If you've dedicated a small time slot for consistently chipping away on a project, walk away when that time slot is done even if you're in the flow. The ability to do this everyday is more important that doing a lot in one day. Stopping helps develop the patience muscle to keep getting after it day after day.\n\t- Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality. Your initial work will always be unoriginal, but you have to \"stay on the bus\" long enough till true originality starts to emerge.\n\n### 12: The Loneliness of the Digital Nomad\n\n- Time is not useful if you are forced to experience it all on your own. It is a \"networked good\", whose value is higher when other people's time is shared and co-ordinated with yours (like a phone; it's no use having it all to yourself)\n- In the post-covid world, there is an increasing number of people who work from anywhere in the work, aka, the digital nomad. But people found that without a sense of community, it gets increasingly lonely.\n- In USSR, Stalin's chief economist, Yuri Larin,  suggested having a staggered day off in the week, so that the factories can run all week, and increase productivity. The result was the people were unhappy because their inner circle never had time off at the same time. Time off only makes sense if it is synced with others you want to spend your time with.\n- This is why Sweden's, *fika* works so well. In a fika, the entire workplace gathers at the same time in the day for coffee and cake, and they even get offended if people don't show up at a fika. You dont control your time off in this case, but it makes it very meaningful to connect with others.\n- Burkeman talks about keeping in sync during drills, in a choir, or in communal prayers where time feels more *vivid*, when it is filled with more meaning.\n- We need to draw a balance between individual and communal time to extract most meaning out of life. Too much of either can be detrimental to overall happiness.\n\n### 13: Cosmic Insignificance Theory\n\n-  In the time scale of the cosmos, our finite lives are truly insignificant, and the universe could not care less about what we do with our time.\n- Burkeman says that the whole of human civilization is about sixty lifetimes, and goes on to conclude that our own lifetime is nothing but a meaningless flicker.\n\t- This absolutely makes no sense. If all of human civilization is *only* sixty lifetimes, then each of our lives is absolutely meaningful, and what we do with our time can affect the course of human civilization, no matter in how miniscule a way.\n\t- He says if we realized how insignificant we are, we would not even be motivated to propagate our genes. Another absurd claim.\n- What does make sense is to not hold ourselves to a unrealisitic standard of what can be considered a significnat life well spent.\n\n### 14: The Human Disease\n\nBurkeman poses five questions that we can answer for ourselves to assess the reality of our finite-time situation:\n\n1. *‚ÄúWhere in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what‚Äôs called for is a little discomfort?‚Äù*  -- you want to make sure you're making choices that result in personal growth.\n2. *‚ÄúAre you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?‚Äù* -- be realisitic in what you can do.\n3. *‚ÄúIn what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?‚Äù* -- don't prove yourself to anyone, or meet expectations set by others, instead accept who you are and what you can achieve.\n4. *‚ÄúIn which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù* -- you may never reach mastery on a skill you're working on, so get started with what you have right now and do what you will with it.\n5. *‚ÄúHow would you spend your days differently if you didn‚Äôt care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?‚Äù* -- avoid being driven by results to achieve satisfaction; the journey is just as important.\n\n\n\n### Quotes\n\n\u003e‚ÄúWe labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life,‚Äù wrote Nietzsche, ‚Äúbecause to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe treat everything we‚Äôre doing‚Äîlife itself, in other words‚Äîas valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else.‚Äù -- in the context of instrumentalizing time.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúOur obsession with extracting the greatest future value out of our time blinds us to the reality that, in fact, the moment of truth is always now‚Äîthat life is nothing but a succession of present moments, culminating in death, and that you‚Äôll probably never get to a point where you feel you have things in perfect working order. And that therefore you had better stop postponing the ‚Äúreal meaning‚Äù of your existence into the future, and throw yourself into life now.‚Äù\n\n\u003e‚ÄúIn order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth‚Äù\n\n---\n### References\n\nOliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021, 1st Ed.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Forte-2022":{"title":"B-Forte-2022","content":"\n![BookCover|300](https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/07/30/original/Shelf_Help_Building_a_Second_Brain_1659188011198.jpg)\n\n## What is a second brain and how does it work?\n\nIn today's digital world we are inundated with information in the form of books, articles, podcasts, tweets and so on. If we do not have a way to capture and store snippets of information from this constant barrage of knowledge, there is no way for our brains to recall important snippets of information when it is needed.\n\nEnter \"the [[second brain]]\", a digital [[commonplace book]], where we capture information and organize it in a meaningful way that enables easy retrieval later. It is a form of [[personal knowledge management]] where we build up a repository of knowledge that is relavant to our interests and pull from it for the rest of our lives.  \n\nIn the professional world, [[notetaking]] involves creating notes while viewing them as a knowledge building block. Collect enough of them and reconstruct it in your own way to create something beautiful or important. The length and format of a note does not matter, as long as it is interpreted through your own lens, curated by your tastes, and drawn from your personal experience (this is in direct contrast to [[zettelkasten]] where notes should be as succint as possible [[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow|zettelkasten workflow]], [[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work|writing with zettelkasten]]; Forte does bring up the reduction of a note to it's essence later however).\n\nUsing a second brain system has the following benefits:\n- It helps us declutter out minds by putting thoughts down as notes\n- Reveals new associations between ideas (it's not entirely clear how though, as we will see later; in zettelkasten, the links between notes exist to make clear connections)\n- Incubate our ideas over time (we tend to choose our most recent ideas and run with it - [[recency bias]]; using old notes might help us discover older but still good ideas)\n- Sharpen our perspectives ([[personal knowledge management]] systems gives us a trove of supporting material we can pull from to make a point on any topic)\n\n## The CODE Framework\n\n[[Tiago Forte]] proposes the Capture, Organize, Distill, Express (CODE) framework to implement the second brain system.\n\n- ==Capture==: Whenever something \"resonates\" with you, capture it in your notetaking system. It is not an analytical decision - identify things that incite, curiousity, pleasure, wonder, or excitement.\n- ==Organize==: Save notes by **actionability**, based on your current projects.\n- ==Distill==: Reduce the idea to it's key concept, in it's most concise form.\n- ==Express==: Use all your capture to create something new.\n\n### CAPTURE\n\nMany highly creative people have a creative process that they rely on. [[Taylor Swift]] writes down snippets of lyrics or music that comes into her mind at random times, and then relies on that to build up her music writing process. [[Jerry Seinfeld]] wrote down all ideas for jokes in a yellow legal pad and filed it away in an accordian folder, and used that to write all his material. The key here lies in capturing what comes across your way so that it can be transformed into somthing useful later.\n\nOne pitfall in the capture process is saving too much information. There needs to be some criteria for how to choose what needs to be captured. Broadly, it should have at least some of the following elements: Inspiring, Useful, Personal, Surprising. The recommendation is to ultimately capture what \"resonates\" - as loose as this term may be. In all cases, *the source of the note* should be captured.\n\n### ORGANIZE - THE PARA FRAMEWORK\n\nThe framework to organize notes is based on actionability - \"In which project will this be most useful?\" - and is based on the PARA System; **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, **Archives**.\n\n- Projects -  These are current projects you are working on, which could include work, personal or side projects. You could put notes related to each project directly into its associated project folder.\n- Areas - These are broader \"areas\" in your life that are not tied to a particular project. They could be things like Health, Finance, Writing, Music, etc. Notes that fall into these areas of interest area stored in its own location, and can be easily pulled from later.\n- Resources - These are topics you are interested in, and generally serve no immediate purpose other than your broad interest in them. They serve as a source for research material later on, if you happen to convert these areas of interest into projects.  Some examples are - Notetaking, Nutrition, Music Recording, Habit formation, etc.\n- Archives - All things no longer relevant from the previous three areas go here. Projects that are done or abandoned, areas that are no longer relevant, or resources you are no longer interested in.\n\nWhenever you capture a note, ask yourself which of these areas it belongs to, and categorize it appropriately. Notes do not permanently live in any category, they are constantly moving and rearranging depending on how your interests and priorities progress.\n\n### DISTILL\n\nWhen you are creating notes for your future self, it is important to find ways to convey the idea from any given note in its most succint form to your future self who will likely not have the time to review the note in its original captured form. This is where the need to distill comes in.\n\nThe method used to distill a note into its essence is called [[Progressive Summarization]]. You pick up any particular note and create highlights of the important parts, and you can do this at several levels:\n- Level 1 - Highlight all the important aspects of the note, so that you can tell the essence of the note by just reading the highlights.\n- Level 2 - Bold (or use another highlighter color) to highlight your earlier highlights so that just a few sentences can tell you what the note is about.\n- Level 3 - At the top of the note, write an executive summary of the note in your own words that you can quickly read to understand the gist of it. This level is probably not needed for all notes.\n\nTo be effective, it is important to \"take-away\" from the note and only leave in what captures the absolute essence of the note.\n\nPitfalls in the highlighting process:\n- Over highlighting - marking up too much of the original note makes it useless to your future self because you are going to have to re-read all of that again.\n- Highlighting without a purpose - you should only be doing the highlighting on a particular note when you have the intention to actually use it for something. You don't have to highlight every note you capture.\n- Making highlighting difficult - highlighting should be an easy process while relying on the feeling of \"resonance\", and not an overly analytical activity.\n\nThe key point here is that *every time you touch a note, you leave it a bit more discoverable for your future self*.\n\n### EXPRESS\n\nThis is the final stage of the [[notetaking]] process that you have been working towards. All of those notes mean nothing if you do not create something with them. Notes are not meant to be collected, but used to create something new and different.\n\nBreak down the work that is to be done into smaller sized [[intermediate packets]].  They are individual concrete blocks that make up your work. There are 5 kinds of intermediate packets that you can use in your work.\n- Distilled notes - Books or notes you have read, that are broken down to its essence using the [[progressive summarization]] technique\n- Outtakes - ideas that didnt make it in a previous project\n- Work in process - documents created during past projects\n- Final deliverables - Completed projects that can kick off something new\n- Documents created by others -  work created by others that you can use as a starting point for your own work\n\nThe main idea here is no matter what form of material you use as a starting point, you should use that as a template for your own work, while giving credit where it is due. So, always look around you for work that you have already done, or work others did that you can use as a template. \n\nThis is a powerful idea that is very applicablle in the workplace and in creative endeavors. Did an employee use a really nice  format of representing data? Ask him/her if it is okay if you reuse their method. Did you hear a good beat or riff? Use that as a starting point, and play with the tune adding your own flavor to it. \n\nThere are several advantages to using intermediate packets:\n- You are working on a small chunk of work at a time. You are less prone to interruptions, and will likely get that chunk of work done.\n- You will be ready to work at a moments notice because you know you can finish off a small chunk of work, instead of waiting for a time when you can fully concentrate.\n- You can collect feedback on smaller chunks of work, instead of going through with the whole thing and finding out it does not meet requirements.\n- You will have many such chunks collected over time that you can easily reuse them in future work.\n\nWhen you break up a project into intermediate packets, ask yourself: \"How do I assemble each of these components without having to make them myself?\"\n\nHere is where I believe this entire book falls apart - the retrieval methods. Very little time is spent on how exactly notes can be retrieved while making connections that did not exist before. Here is what the books suggests as ways to extract notes and insight out of the system:\n- Search - Just blatant keyword searches in the notes app might show you what you are looking for\n- Browsing - You manually browse through the PARA folder structure looking for stuff you need\n- Tags - tagging notes allows you to traverse past rigid folder hierarchies, but as we all know, the method of tagging breaks down when you have too many tags or cant remember them\n- Serendipity - Randomly look around PARA folders to see if something else in there interests you (this is very random, how will you even know where to look? what if there is valuable insight but you just didnt look at it?)\n\nThe main content of this part is that *everything is a remix*. Use your notes system to hash out something with your own personal flavor.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Meyer-1976-Ch4":{"title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits","content":"![meyer](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KleHb8JHL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n- Bias circuits designed with current sources tend to be more insensitive to power-supply and temperature variations\n- For small currents, they tend to have a smaller on-chip footprint compared to resistor based techniques\n- As active loads, they provide high impedance, enabling high gain in voltage amplifiers\n\n\n\n## 4.2 Simple Current Source\n\n### ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\n\nTransistor Q1 is diode-connected which means that the collector-base voltage is zero.

He attributes their success to what he defines as **Deep Work**, which is defined as:\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúProfessional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.‚Äù\n\nHere are some examples of people who have had a tendency to go into deep focus modes when doing their work:\n1. Carl Jung, built a house for himself where he could isolate himself for work\n2. Mark Twain wrote in a shed away from the family, who had to blow a horn to alert him for meals\n3. Peter Higgs, physicist, was so isolated that people could not find him to tell him he had won the nobel prize\n4. Bill Gates stayed in his lakeside cottage for two \"Think Weeks\" in a year, from where he wrote the famous \"Internet Tidal Wave\" memo\n\nBut we live in a time where distraction is celebrated by being instantly responsive on communication platforms, and in contrast most knowledge workers perform **Shallow Work**, defined as,\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúNoncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.‚Äù\n\nIt appears that the modern world is permanently erasing our ability to perform Deep Work. Instead of nostalgically looking at our distraction-free past, deep work today has more meaning than ever before for two reasons:\n1. It is valuable to quickly learn complicated things\n2. In the digital age, creating valuable work has incredible reach- more than ever before\nIn the internet age, more and more people are becoming knowledge workers, and those who have the ability to do deep work, will stand out above the others. This is called the **Deep Work Hypothesis**.\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.‚Äù\n\nIt is notable that deep work does not mean long hours. It is a period of intense focus every for 3-4 hours a day, that is capable of producing valuable output. A deep life is a good life, as Newport says.\n\n### Deep Work is Valuable\n\nIn this section, three \"successful\" people are provided as examples, and the reason for their success is considered. Our future economy looks increasingly *divided* where easy to replicate jobs will be automated away, and hard to replicate jobs will become more valuable. Let's see who these people are and what makes them valuable.\n1. Nate Silver- a statistician who took his love of baseball to election predictions\n\t1. ==A highly skilled worker==, who is capable of taking data and manipulating it with machines to successfully predict new outcomes\n2. David Hansson- a programmer who created Ruby on Rails, used a lot to build the internet\n\t1. ==A superstar whose skillset is clearly at a premium==, and it often makes more economic sense to hire a superstar to get the job done instead of hiring a team of mediocre programmers not capable of that kind of output\n\t2. Everybody's skill today is traded on a \"universal bazaar\" where the best will clearly dictate a premium over all others\n3. John Doerr- a venture capitalist who fueled many major and successful tech companies\n\t1. ==A wealthy individual with lots of investable capital==, can fund a company like Instagram which sold for a billion dollars with only 13 people\n\nNot everyone has capital to invest, but the first two are definitely worth looking at. Our interest essentially lies in how we develop the ability to:\n1. quickly master hard things\n2. produce at an elite level (quality and speed)\n\nThe contrary is also important to consider and Newport states:\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt produce, you won‚Äôt thrive‚Äîno matter how skilled or talented you are.‚Äù\n\nBoth of these skills essentially depends on our ability to do deep work.\n\nTo develop the ability to master hard things, we need to have\n1. Intense concentration where all our attention is solely focused on overcoming the challenge ahead of us, without distraction\n2. Deliberate practice to fail multiple times, use the feedback from the experience and correct your methods till you achieve success\n3. Neurological scaffolding called Myelin, which is a fatty tissue that develops around neurons when they are being used to do challenging tasks. Repeated work triggers oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around neurons\n\nNewport uses the example of Adam Grant, the youngest tenured prof at Wharton, who produced an absurdly high number of papers and a best selling book Give and Take. He takes the fall semester to do all his teaching and then all this research is batched into spring and summer. He also uses smaller batches to time to work deep, by putting out-of-office notices when he is working on a paper.\n\nThe reason you need long stretches of time to do deep work is due to attention residue. When you switch from one task to another, there is a residue left over from the previous task. This is entirely antithetical to the idea of multi-tasking where the semi-distracted state never lets you ultimately focus.\n\nWhat about Jack Dorsey? The twitter ex-CEO famously spends time in meetings and conversations with people doing what we define here as shallow work. He is still an effective leader and has proven he can disrupt the industry. Why? Deep work is not always applicable to all kinds of people in all roles. But in most circumstances deep work is usually valuable. There are always exceptions to the rule.\n\n### Deep work is rare\n\nToday's work culture is chock full of terms that are meant to keep people and ideas \"connected\" together; open workpaces, instant messaging, social media. Many organizations *require* their employees to respond instantly to emails and messages, and even to develop a social media presence, while not prioritizing deep work as a fundamental component of achieving productivity in a workplace.\n\nThe reason the companies do not see that the always-connected trend is detrimental to their business is due to the **metric black hole**, which is another way of saying that it is difficult to put a monetary value on the impact on the business causes by these office distractions which keep people away from deep work.\n\nWhat are some of the mental models that cause people to embrace distractions instead of deep work?\n- Principle of least resistance\n\t- Getting an answer to your question immediately makes your work easier, at least for the time being\n\t- People appear to be working when sending/receiving emails even if they have nothing else to show for work. Companies seem to permit working out of an email inbox.\n\t- Setting weekly meetings on the pretext of following up on projects is a proxy for staying on track with your own work, even if others have nothing to contribute in your meeting.\n- Busyness as a proxy for productivity\n\t- Knowledge work lacks real metrics to show that you have been productive\n\t- Being visibly busy is a viable option to prove to management that you are productive (even if you have nothing to show for it)\n- The cult of the internet\n\t- We have come to accept the \"internet\" as being good for us, often without considering the ramifications entirely.\n\t- This technopoly assumes that everyone should and will adopt the latest in technology because it is \"good\" for them (why won't you have a cell phone? do you know how convienient it is?)\n\nWith distractions from social media and the culture of connectivity in workplaces, deep work is becoming increasing rare, which is really bad for businesses. However, if everyone is always in a distracted state, those who are capable of deep work will suddenly find themselves in a fortunate position when they can produce at an elite level.\n\n### Deep work is meaningful\n\nEverything is not always about being successful and wealthy. Deep work is capable making a life meaningful and well worth living. The following arguments will prove that it is so, in a neurological, psychological and philosophical sense.\n\n**Neurological**: Science writer, Winifred Gallagher, in her book Rapt, says that our quality of life depends on what we pay attention to and what we ignore. Most often, we look at it backwards, ie, what happens to us should dictate how we feel. (There are some fMRI experiement arguments trying to support the neurological origin for this argument that does not make much sense.)\n\nDeep work allows your attention to focus on what is important, and ignore the minute stresses that are present in shallow work such as emails and instant messages. As such this results in an improved quality of life, because the small stuff does not stress us out throughout the day. A meaningful connection with your work can be very fulfilling.\n\n**Psychological**: When humans are deeply immersed in a challeging activity, they engage the limits of the mental powers while achieving what Csikszentmihalyi calls a *flow state* during which time takes on a different meaning, and a deep sense of satisfaction and happiness emerges.\n\n**Philosophical**: Sacredness has always been connected to meaning in the course of human culture, but since the evolution of Descartes' skepticism which put an individual over the importance of an all-knowing god, has led us to a life devoid of meaning. However, by dedicating ourselves to our craft, we can once again spark that connection to the sacredness and meaning.  Cultivating craftsmanship is a deep task that requires a commitment to deep work. It can be argued that our daily job is much too mundane to be sacred. This is because we have been led to believe that rarified jobs (nonprofits, startups, unique roles) are the only ones with meaning. Newport refutes this with\n\u003e[!quote] You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work\n\n### Rule 1: Work Deeply\n\nDavid Dewane envisions what he calls *The Eudaimonia Machine* which is an architectural concept for a workspace whose sole purpose is to enable deep work. The structure is a one-storey narrow rectangle with five rooms placed in a line, but there are no shared hallways. You need to pass through each room to get to the next one. The five rooms are\n1. *The Gallery*: contains examples of deep work produced in the building, to create a healthy mix of stress and peer pressure\n2. *The Salon*: a place to create intense curiousity and arguments that you will later develop deeper in the machine\n3. *The Library*: has records of all work produced in the machine, and has copies and scanners that you can use to collect material for your own deep work\n4. *The Office*: place to complete all the shallow work needed for your projects, email notes, webpage clippings, note collections.\n5. *The Chamber*: room with sound proof wall for total focus. The intention is to spend 90 minutes at a time and take a 90 minute break, and repeat this a few times a day will the brain has reached it's capacity for deep work.\n\nWe need to somehow emulate this process in our daily lives so that we can slip into deep work modes. We always have the urge to turn to something superficial, and this is the biggest obstacle to deep work. Roy Baumeister established that *willpower* is a finite resource that gets depleted as you use it. The key is to *not* rely on willpower to do deep work but instead develop a work habit that adds routines and rituals to put you in a state of intense concentration.\n\n==**Decide on your depth philosophy**==\n\nYou *must* decide on a depth philosophy that best suites your lifestyle and commitments. Here are some options:\n- Monastic\n\t- This is most suitable for people who have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that only comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well\n\t- Applies to people like Donald Knuth where he spends his time on computer programming or Neal Stephanson, writing science fiction novels. These people usually have a single point of focus in their lives (novels for Neal Stephanson; to produce accessible forms of computer science knowledge to people, for Donald Knuth)\n\t- This may not apply to people who have meetings to attend to at work, and other shallow commitments that are a requirement to fulfill\n- Bimodal\n\t- Define a clearly defined stretch of time in a week to deep work and leave the rest open to everything else. However, the amount of time has to be substantially long (at least a full day) for one to reach maximum cognitive load.\n\t- This method of deep work is best suited to those who have committments that involve shallow tasks, whether they like it or not (most people).\n\t- Carl Jung used split his time between his retreat and treating patients in his clinic. Adam Grant, the Wharton professor, split his time between teaching in fall, and research in summer and spring. They used bimodal depth philosophies.\n\t- The key to making this work is to make yourself unavailable during deep work periods, and totally accessible during open work times. The hope is people working with you will come to accept this work modality.\n- Rhythmic\n\t- In this philosophy, you commit yourself to habits where you work deeply at a prescribed time. You could also create for yourself a calendar where you mark your deep work, and as you build up a work streak, you will be hesitant to break it.\n\t- The mode of work is most suitable to office workers\n\t- This seems to be a very short time-scale implementation of the bimodal approach. The difference between this method and the bimodal method is elucidated clearly by Newport.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach will not produce the level of depth that bimodal would, but this form of work is much more suitable to reality.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach is capable of logging more deep work hours in a given year compared to bimodal, by its sheer repetitive nature.\n- Journalistic\n\t- Here, you fit in deep work at any time you get a chance to. You should have the ability to quickly sink into deep concentration and work deeply. \n\t- This is something that is only acquired by practice and is not often suitable for a beginner. A beginner will likely quickly deplete willpower reserves. Also, one must have the conviction that the work at hand is important, which usually only happens to already accomplished people.\n\t- The journalist Walter Isaacson apparently worked on his book any chance he got. Newport also admits to using this technique to write this book. Although not as spontaneous, he mapped out in advance any free time he had to write this book.\n\n**==Ritualize==**\n\nCompletely ignore the need for inspiration to do deep work, and create idiosyncratic rituals to minimize all friction in getting to work. A ritual can be designed around the following considerations:\n1. Specify a location for your deep work, and decide how long you will work.\n2. Define rules and metrics, such as no internet, external communication, or words typed in a fixed time interval\n3. Minimize all friction required to do work. Use good stationary, appropriate computer peripherals, computer files ready to go, coffee if you need it.\n\nThese principles cement into your mind that your deep work is the highest priority and needs this kind of committment.\n\n**==Make Grand Gestures==**\n\nIncrease the perceived importance of a task by making a *grand gesture* that often involves significant effort or energy. Here are some fun examples:\n- J.K. Rowling checked into the 5-star Balmoral Hotel to finish the last Harry Potter book. Physicist \n- Physicist and novelist, Alan Lightman retires to a remote island in Maine with no phone access. \n- William Shockley invented the junction transistor by locking himself in a Chicago hotel. \n- Entrepreneur Peter Shankman found that he wrote best when on a plane. So to meet a deadline, he booked a round trip flight to Japan and wrote for the next 30 hours.\n\n**==Don't Work Alone==**\n\nSo far in the book, it seems that going solo is the only way to work deeply at all. However, collaboration and interaction with others is an important aspect in creative work. *The whiteboard effect*, a term coined by Newport to describe the phenomenon where your collaborator pushes you into deeper work, than when you were working alone. This is the basis of the \"open-workspace\" concept applied in offices today, and it seems to have it's origins in Building 20, in MIT, where this lab produced an enormous amount of work ranging from the first solar cell, to fiber optics. This hastily constructed lab in MIT housed people of multiple unrelated disciplies working together, and this is the often cited reasons for why open workspaces work. \n\nHowever, Newport argues that even Building 20 has a \"hub-and-spoke\" architecture, where people congregated in hubs to discuss ideas and then retreated to their spoke to work deeply. I recommend reading this chapter for more reasoning of why this is so, and how it works. In contrast, our open workspace offices provide nothing but constant distraction. The key to successful collaboration is treat interaction and deep work as two separate entities, and therefore need to be optimized separately. Do collaborate when necessary, but be cautious to not overdo it, at the cost of your own ability to do deep work.\n\n**==Execute like a business==**\n\nIn this section, Newport explains how he adapted a book titled \"The 4 Disciplines of Execution\" - a book about corporate strategy - to how to spend more time working deeply. The four \"adapted\" disciplines as related to deep work are:\n\n1. **Focus on the wildly important**: Identify and work on a small number of ambitious outcomes\n2. **Act on Lead Measures**: Lag measures are metrics evaluated after a relevant span of time, but lead measures are metrics that can be evaluated immediately towards a goal. Instead of defining a lag measure like, \"I will write X papers this year\", adopt a lead measure like, \"I will spend 4 hours in deep work everyday.\"\n3. **Keep a compelling scoreboard**: Setup a real scoreboard that measures the amount of time spent in deep work. A simple way is to write down deep work hours in a calendar, and mark off important milestones achieved to indicate how many deep work hours were required to achieve that goal.\n4. **Create a cadence of accountability**: Setup a weekly review with yourself to go over your deep work count, identify wins and losses, and make course corrections for the next week.\n\n**==Be Lazy==**\n\nGiving yourself time to recover from deep work, so that you can attack the next day with the same intensity is vitally important. To ensure this happens, Newport suggests that one invents a shutdown routine you go through to tell your mind that the work for the day is done, and from that point on, you do not apply your mind to any work activity. Here are some reasons why shutting down is important:\n\n1. **Downtime aids insights**: A well rested mind is capable of making much better connections between ideas, and improves creativity and problem solving.\n2. **Downtime helps recharge**: Directed attention, like willpower, is finite, and is easily exhausted. To replenish our reserves, we need downtime where our mind is put at ease by engaging in relaxing activities.\n3. **Working during downtimes results in poor quality**: Our capacity for deep work in a day is limited to about 4 hours, which you should fit into your workday. Any work done outside of that is usually of poor quality.\n\nThe need for a shutdown ritual is important when considering the Zeigernik effect- which points out that incomplete tasks will dominate our attention. Note that the task need not actually be completed, but we need to devise a way to trick the brain into thinking that it's completed, at least for now. This is where a strict shutdown ritual helps, and it can be something like this:\n\n1. Review all incomplete tasks, goals and projects\n2. Make sure you have a plan for it's completion\n3. Capture all the details in a place you will revisit when the time is right\n4. Verbally declare the day complete (\"Shutdown complete\" or \"That's enough for the day\")\n\nNow, your obligations has been released from your brain, and your recovery period begins. \n\u003e[!quote] When you work, work hard. When you're done, you're done.\n\n### Rule 2: Embrace Boredom\n\nLike most skills, the ability to work deeply and concentrate intensely cannot be gained overnight. Much like anything else, it requires repeated and deliberate practice. However, it is not sufficient to simply practice concentrating on a task. We must actively work on minimizing our distractions. \n\nWith the ubiquity of smart phones, we have the ability to distract ourselves at a moments notice, when we are standing in line at the grocery store, or when we are waiting for a friend to arrive, by getting on social media or checking news and email. Unless we work on staving off the need to distract ourselves, there is no way our ability to concentrate will improve. We must *embrace boredom*. This chapter outlines some strategeies to minimize distraction and practise focus.\n\n**==Take breaks from focus, instead of breaks from distraction==**\n\nA popular strategy to break away from distracton addiction is to take an Internet Sabbath, a day devoid of any digital devices, once every week. Newport suggests an alternative, where instead of taking a break from distraction so you can focus, you instead take a break from focus for distraction.\n\nFor example, schedule in advance when you will use the internet by writing down on a notepad the exact time you will allowed to browse the internet. This will force ourselves not to reach for distraction at the slightest hint of boredom.\n\n- This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use / emails\n\t- You will just need to schedule more internet blocks to get the job done\n- Time outside of internet blocks should be absolutely free from internet use\n\t- If you find the need to get a piece of information online to do your job offline, you must resist the temptation to go online immediately, but instead wait for your next online block to roll by. Even take a break to relax if you have to.\n\t- If you happen to go online during an offline block, you will risk running in distractions in the form of urgent emails or messages from people.\n- Schedule internet use at home as well\n\t- This will help unplug from social media and news when at home.\n\t- Only exceptions are time sensitive internet use, like co-ordinating with a friend for dinner.\n\nTo reiterate, the key strategy is to avoid going online at the slightest hint of boredom. This is something to be practiced mindfully, and one must take every opportunity to do so - for exapmle, when waiting in line at the grocery store.\n\n**==Work like Teddy Roosevelt==**\n\nTheodore Roosevelt had an amazing array of interests ranging from body building to naturalism, but he still did well in his classes at Harvard. He was not at the top of his class but he did quite well. His interests left him very little time to actually focus on academics and therefore he worked on school work for only short periods of time but with *blistering intensity*.\n\nHere is how we can adopt this strategy: identify a deep work, high priority task and give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces the time usually taken to do such a task. Make it even harder by publicly proclaiming that deadline, and set a countdown timer and set to work on it. Newport calls such work periods *Roosevelt Dashes*.\n\nAlways make sure you keep Roosevelt dashes on the edge of feasibility, where the successful completion of the task will require levels of concentration higher than usual. It provides interval training for the brain.\n\n**==Meditate Productively==**\n\nProductive meditation is when you focus your attention on a mental task such as outlining an article, or solving a hard problem, while walking, jogging or showering. And whenever you mind starts to wander from the topic you intended to meditate on, you forcibly bring your attention back to the topic at hand.\n\nNewport suggests that two or three such sessions in a week is sufficient, and finding such time blocks is usually easy because it is usually easy to occupy between chores and other tasks on which time would otherwise be spent without thinking anyway.\n\nHere are some potential pitfalls to watch out for:\n- Be wary of distractions and looping\n\t- If you attention is slipping away, gently remind yourself that you're supposed to be thinking about something else, and you can address the distraction later.\n\t- Avoid looping the same thought over and over, which is what happens when addressing a hard problem. Push the mind to go beyond the usual thought process.\n- Structure your deep thinking\n\t- Clearly define what question you are looking to answer\n\t- Gather all the relevant variables and commit them to working memory\n\t- At the end of the session, consolidate your thoughts by reviewing the answer you have come up with\n\n**==Memorize a deck of cards==**\n\nIn this section, Newport goes fairly into depth about strategies for memorizing a deck of cards, and the details are best read from the book itself and are not worth repeating here unless you intend to memorize a deck of cards (which I don't).\n\nThe key takeaway here is that training your memory often leads to an increase in concentration, and any kind of mental training  you can undertake to improve memory will result in concentration gains.\n\n### Rule 3: Quit Social Media\n\nIn this chapter, Newport argues that Social Media has its place in society and the level of adoption in your personal life should be considered with care. The binary nature of the title of this chapter is not what he actually suggests, knowing that many people could either not stick to completely quitting social media, or that some walks of life actually do benefit from social media. So he offers a more nuaced approach.\n\nSocial media is a tool. Like any craftsman, the tool should be adopted only if it's positive impacts substantially outweights its negative impacts. Before adopting every social media platform, ask yourself what the impact is, and then evaluate carefully.\n\n- Identify high level goals in your professional and personal life.\n- List a few activities that help you achieve these goals.\n- Consider the \"network-tools\" like social media, chat, etc, that you use\n- Ask if the tool has a positive, negative, or minimal impact on the listed activities\n- Keep the tool only if positive impact *substantially* outwights the negative impacts\n\nEven if these tools do positively contribute, but only to a small extent, consider not adopting the tool at all. High impact activities that contribute heavily to the overall outcome should be prioritized instead.\n\nActually do try quitting social media for a month and see how it goes. Do you miss people? Do people miss you? What impact does it have on your life? Based on the outcome, you can always get back into it. But if your life has improved as a result of quitting, consider keeping it that way.\n\nArnold Bennett, an English writer, suggests in his self-help classic - *How to live on 24 hours a day* - that there is plenty of time outside of the 8 hour work period where one can focus on self-improvement of various kinds. What this means today is - you can and should make *deliberate* use of your time outside work. Avoid using the internet as a source of entertainment at all time. By no means should you avoid watching a movie or show on TV, but do so with intention. Put more thought into your leisure time. For this, structured hobbies such as reading, music or woodworking are an excellent way to spend free time with intention.\n\nThe argument that working eight hours in the day will tire your mental faculties so much that you will not be able to spend leisure time with intention is a myth. Arnold Bennett writes-\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúWhat? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change‚Äînot rest, except in sleep.‚Äù\n\nIn summary, give your brain a quality alternative to relaxation other than social media and online entertainment. Learn to live, not just exist.\n\n### Rule 4: Drain the Shallows\n\nFind ways to tame shallow work in your day to day life because it is usually not as important as it seems. It has a habit of dangerously eating into your deep work time. Sadly, most knowledge work has some amount of shallow work. It is prudent to schedule shallow work after we have exhausted our capacity for deep work.\n\nNewport suggests three main strategies to minimize shallow work.\n\n==**Schedule Every Minute**==\n- Newport suggests that one must schedule every minute, and chart out a plan on paper with \"task-blocks,\" which are free to expand and contract as the work needs. If disrupted, one simply rearranges the task-blocks and continues. If an important insight shows up, then it is okay to abandon all task-blocks for the rest of the day.\n- I've actually tried this before I read the book, and it gets exhausting after some time. I'm not sure it works for me.\n- The key takeaway is to be *intentional* with your time, and make sure you do not slip into autopilot mode.\n\n==**Quantify the depth of every activity**==\n- To quantify the depth of a task, ask how long (in months) it would take to train a recent smart college grad with no specialized training to do the task? If the answer is many months, then the task clearly has some depth. After sorting tasks by quantifying them, prioritize deep work over shallow.\n\n==**Ask your boss for a shallow work budget**==\n- Anywhere between 30-50% is a reasonable ask for purely shallow work. Anything more than 50%, and you will be viewed as a hermit with deep thoughts. Anything less than 30%, and there is a fear you won't respond to email.\n- You maintain the ratio of these work types, you will have to say no to shallow tasks like weekly sync meetings, and instead ask for a more results driven interaction, where you meet when there are results to report.\n- If your boss insists that you are still required to respond immediately to responses, even if they do interrupt, then it is time to look for a new position that values depth in work.\n\n==**Finish your work by 5:30pm**==\n- *Fixed schedule productivity* - where you need to finish your work by a given time of day, requires you to ruthlessly say no to anything that will not allow you to do deep work. At this point, you will be forced to adopt a scarcity mindset and find all ways to minimize shallow work.\n\n==**Become hard to reach**==\n- Make people who send you email do more work, by setting conditions that the emailer has to satisfy, so that they can expect a response from you. Newport calls this a sender filter. For example, you can blatantly state that you will respond only if interests match. There is nothing offensive in doing this.\n- Do more work when  you send emails. Newport suggests that you use process centric emails to respond to people, instead of responding in an open ended fashion. Attempt to provide enough details or outline enough steps that the email sender has a clear picture of what needs to be done next. This will minimize the number of emails you receive, and also close the loop on the issue at hand.\n- Don't respond. Adopt a mentality that the default reaction is not to respond at all. This might not work in all situations.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Tsividis-1987-Ch1":{"title":"Operation and Modeling of the MOS Transistor","content":"\n![tsividis](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wL-KP1sNL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n\n\n## 1.2 Semiconductors\n\nWe will deal with silicon as semiconductor, and assume that it is in thermal equilibrium without any external influences.\n\n### Properties of semiconductors\n\n- A silicon crystal has a lattice of atoms held together in a three-dimensional structure called a [[crystal lattice]].\n- Atoms are held together using a [[valence bond]] associated with the electron of the atom. In absolute zero, these electrons exactly counteract the positive charge in the electron's nucleus\n- With thermal energy, the electron is knocked loose from the atom and becomes a [[free electron]] which can now freely move throught the lattice, and can cause electric current to flow\n- The resulting positive charge is called a [[hole]] and can also move through the lattice by electrons from neighboring atoms filling the hole and becoming positive themselves.\n\n\n\n\n## 1.5 The PN junction\n\n### Without external bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-no-external-bias.png]]\n\n- N-type and P-type semiconductors are brought together to make a PN junction. When the doping changes from one type to another abruptly it is called a *step* junction.\n- There are metallic contacts on either extreme of materials where connection to the external world is made.\n- Due to the concentration difference across the interface of these two regions:\n\t- Electrons will diffuse from the n-region to the p-region, leaving behing positivitly charged donor atoms\n\t- Holes will diffuse from the p-region to the n-region leaving behind negatively charged acceptor atoms\n- An electric field builds up internal to the PN junction due to the ionized impurities in either region, and the direction of the field goes from the n- to p-region.\n\t- Any further holes diffusing from p- to n-type, will be repelled by this field\n\t- Any further electron diffucing from n- to p-type will be repelled by this field\n- The potential difference across this region is called the ==built-in potential== of the junction, and is denoted by $\\phi_{bi}$.\n\t$$\\phi_{bi} = \\phi_{Fp}-\\phi_{Fn}$$\n\twhere, $\\phi_{Fp}$ and $\\phi_{Fn}$ are the Fermi potentials of the p-side and n-side respectively.\n- This will result in a region in each doped semiconductor which is devoid of any free charges. This is called the ==depletion region==.\n* If n-type is more heavily doped (as shown in figure), then the depletion width $d_1$ in the n-type region is lesser than $d_2$ in the p-type region, because there are more carriers per unit area, which means more charge can be uncovered in relatively short depth. \n* If n-type is heavily doped so that $N_D \u003e\u003e N_A$,  then most of the potential is dropped across the p-type region, and $\\phi_2 \\approx \\phi_{bi}$\n* The depletion width $d_1$ will be very small and $d_2$ can be calculated as :\n$$\nd_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s}{qN_A}}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n- The charge per unit area on the p-side is given by\n$$\nQ'_2=-\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_sN_A}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n\n### With forward bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-forward-bias.png]]\n\n- If a positive voltage V is applied to the p-side, the junction is forward biased\n- The external voltage will lower the builtin potential to $\\phi_{bi}-V$\n- The electrons supplied from the negative terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some of the charges in the depletion region on the n-side, and the holes supplied from the positive terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some charges in the depletion region on the p-side\n- The overall depth of the depletion regions on each side will decrease\n- Electrons and holes do not face as much as a potential barrier and will cross over from one side to the other in the pn junction resulting in the flow of current which is\n$$\nI = I_0(e^{V/\\phi_t}- 1)\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ depends on the pn junction doping and geometry, and $\\phi_t$ is the thermal voltage.\n\n### With reverse bias\n![[images/pn-junction-reverse-bias.png]]\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-razavi-microelec":{"title":"Fundamentals of Microelectronics","content":"\n![razavi-microelec](https://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/47/11196951/1119695147.jpg)\n\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n\n- The biasing provided to circuits should be independent of:\n\t- Voltage variation: Eg, the voltage from a battery drops as it discharges slowly\n\t- Temperature variation: Eg, different environments / places have different ambient temperatures\n\n- How does temperature affect the operation of circuits?\n\t- ![[images/impractical-biasing-of-mos-bjt-transistors.jpeg]]\n\t\n\t* BJT example\n\t\t* For a desired current $I_1$,\n\t\t\t* $$\n\t\t\t\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{cc}=V_T ln\\frac{I_1}{I_S}\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t* even if resistors are made of same material, and vary the same amount, $V_T$ and $I_S$ vary with temperature, resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\t- FET example\n\t\t- For a desired current $I_1$\n\t\t\t- $$\n\t\t\tI_1= \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_nC_{ox}(\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{DD}-V_{TH})^2\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t- Even if resistors vary the same amount, mobility $\\mu_n$ and threshold voltage $V_{TH}$ vary with temperature resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\n- It is possible to design a circuit called [[Band Gap Reference]] that can provide voltage- and temperature independent voltage and currents, but this uses 10's of transistors and is fairly complex.\n-  The idea is to generate a golden reference current (or voltage) from a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit, and merely \"copy\" that reference current to wherever it is needed in the whole circuit. The circuit that does the copying is called a current mirror\n\n\n---\n\n## ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\nThe basic idea is to use the current generated from a golden source like a bandgap reference circuit and use that to generate a voltage, which will then be applied to another transistor to generate a copy of the current.\n\n### Circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the logarithm of its input current\n\n![[images/output-voltage-proportional-to-input-current.jpeg|200x200]]\n\nA diode connected bipolar transistor does exactly this. The relationship of voltage $V_1$ to the current $I_{ref}$ is \n$$\nV_1 = V_Tln\\frac{I_{REF}}{I_{S,REF}}\n$$\nwhere $I_{S,REF}$ is the saturation current of the reference transistor.\n\nLet us construct the whole current source now.\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\nThe voltage at the base of transistors Q1 and Q2 is proportional to the natural logarithm of the reference current from the bandgap reference circuit, and is a result of the diode connected transistor Q1. Transistor Q2 takes the voltage at its base and creates a \"copy\" or \"mirrors\" the current to the output side, provided transistors Q1 and Q2 are identical to each other, or some integer multiple thereof.\n\nSo, how does this solve the temperature sensitivity issue? The voltage at the base of the transistors does vary with temperature. But since Q1 and Q2 are identical, they are affected in the same way by temperature. As a result, the copied current is insensitive to temperature.\n\n## ![[permanent/Using a current mirror to create multiple copies, multiples, or fractions of a reference current]]\n\n- Once the $V_{BE}$ voltage has been generated from the reference current (that uses bandgap reference) using the diode connected transistor, it can be used as the $V_{BE}$ for several output transistors.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5, then you can create 3 copies of the reference current.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5 and then tie their collectors together, you can create one 3X copy of the reference current\n\t- If you size the reference transistor to be 3 parallel transistors, and have only one output transistor, you can generate fractional 1/3 current copies.\n\t- If you have a reference transistor of size 3X, and output transistors of size 1X and 12X, you can generate both multiplier and fractional current copies (1/3rd and 4X in this case)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Effect of base current\n\n# References\n\n- Behzad Razavi, Fundamentals of Microelectronics, 2013, Wiley, Chapter 9\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch":{"title":"Introduction to PyTorch","content":"\n*This course was offered to Qualcomm employees as Engineering Development*\n\n### Terminology\n\n[[Artificial Intelligence]] : This is a field of study where machines mimic the intelligence of humans by learning and performing tasks based on the experience or data they are provided.\n\n[[Machine Learning]]: This is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, where the emphasis is on computers learning from data that is provided to them, so that they can perform intelligent tasks such as classifications and predictions.\n\n[[Deep Learning]]: This is a subset of machine learning where computers learn to perform specific tasks, but can perform much more complex (deep) tasks based on the rudimentary building blocks of learning.\n\nOther machine learning approaches involve decision tree based models, and even linear models such as curve fits and regressions still count as [[AI/ML]].\n\n### Principles of Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning draws a very good analogue with Lego blocks. The idea to use pieces to make simple things and then use those simple things to create something more complex. The hierarchy of components one could hypothetically build can be quite \"deep\", and this is where the name comes from. \n\nWhen building a learning model from simpler learning models, the \"pieces\" have to \"fit\" together much like lego blocks do. A simple piece of a learning model can be built with two fundamental operations:\n1. Matrix multiplication\n2. Activation function\n\nThis simple piece constructed from the basic operations above is called a ==fully connected layer==.\n\nTo push the lego analogy further, you can connect several fully-connected layers to build what is called a ==multi-level perceptron-==.\n\nOne of the highly cited papers that shows this Lego action in practice is Szegedy et al 2014 (insert Zotero link). They describe the design of the Inception multilevel perceptron used to classify images.\n\nOne of the other important advantages of Deep Learning is that the learning model only gets better with more and more training data.  This is in contrast to other models like Tree-Based models that stop getting better after a certain amount of data. Also, for decision tree based ML, one cannot sufficiently cover all possible scenarios with \"if\" conditions. The model simply does not get better anymore. xkcd.com/1838\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Pytorch-Day1":{"title":"","content":"Instructor: Ben Sherman from Weights and Biases\n\n### What are AI ML and DL?\n\n- Deep learning is a specific form of machine learning.

They are very valuable for DL acceleration too!\n\t- Python allows for accelerated DL\n\t- High performance and full flexibility can all be done in python\n\t- Have bindings to C++ using CUDA on nVidia GPUs\n- Pytorch\n\t- came from Meta\n\t- Pytorch lightning is a nice framework for python\n\t- CuDNN is low level operations for array operations in DL\n\t- CUDA (c/c++) is low level operations\n- Two major frameworks:\n\t- Tensorflow / Keras -- Google\n\t- Jax -- Google\n\t- Pytorch / Lightning -- Facebook\n- Pytorch is more popular among researchers and is more DIY than Keras\n\t- used more and more these days\n- Pytorch lightning tends to make it more like Keras\n- Tensorflow has more mature tooling for edge cases really, but Pytorch is catching up\n\n### ML as an API\n\n- API tells us it does something without telling us how\n\n- 3 methods / functions\n\t- Loss\n\t\t- inspect model predictions, and says how good the model is doing in predictions\n\t\t- measure of prediction quality\n\t\t- You have a predetermined cat dataset; how well does AI predict that.\n\t- Model.forward\n\t\t- A forward pass through the large computational graph that constitutes the learning system\n\t- Model.fit\n\t\t- takes examples in, makes model better\n\t\t- use a known dataset to train the model\n\n- 3 types of API\n\t- Model -- the AI of the system\n\t- Inputs -- kind of data model takes in (images, 3d scans)\n\t- Targets -- kind of data you predict with Model, or Model output\n\n- Training and deployment --  think of it as development and production\n\n- First do model.fit to teach the DL system\n- loss is like a testing/CI that tells you how well you are doing\n- model.forward is to use it in production\n\n- Inputs and targets are both kinds of data\n\t- inputs: data model sees and uses to make decisions\n\t\t- determined by what data you have\n\t- targets: data model is trying to produce, only seen during training\n\t\t- determined by the problem (cats or not cats)\n\t- Need both during training phase\n\t- But in production, you will not have targets, only inputs\n\n- Example: feed grams vs chicken weight\n\t- Linear regression is enough. Still a type of ML!\n\t- Use loss to \"score\" the model. Lower is better.\n\t- Prediction comes from model.forward\n\t- compare that to the known correct value\n\t- Calculate loss (rms error is one kind)\n\n- One hot vector -- vectorized representation of the correct answer.\n\n```python\ntrained_model = Model.fit(training_inputs, known_outputs)\n```\n\nUsing fit to make a model better\n```python\nuntrained_model = Model()\nuntrained_outputs = untrained_model.forward(training_inputs)\nuntrained_loss = loss(untrained_outputs, training_targets)\n\ntrained_model = untrained_model.fit(training_inputs, training_targets)\n```\n\nWhen is a model good?\n- Make sure that loss in production is better than a certain number.\n\n### Perceptrons\n\nDigit recognition problem is the helloworld of ML!\n- Could you identify handwritten digits using Python?\n- Rules based methods based on conditions will not work for something like this\n\nFrank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron 1960 to solve such problems. How did his machine work?\n- uses variable resistors whose value can be set by knobs, and a light that turns on\n- Imagine you have a knob for each pixel in image of 5\n- Set the knobs so that light turns on when the number is 5\n- You just trained the perceptron\n\nMathematical model of a perceptron\n- Multiply each input by a weight (like the knobs)\n- Sum all the weighted inputs\n- Pass the sum through an activation function (like the lightbulb)\n\nFirst two steps is the dot product of the input vector and weight vector. You can add a constant to it if needed. This simple linalg solves super fast on GPU\n\nIn pytorch, this is called a `Linear` block.\n\n- Break the input dataset into batches (like 32 out the 1000)\n\t- this is needed because datasets can be really really big\n- Dataloaders do this, the behave like lists\n- One pass through of entire dataset while adjusting weights in reponse to the inputs is called an ==epoch==\n- \n\nUse `Trainer.fit` in pytorch lightning to do the fit.\n- Iterates over Dataloader\n- calls ==Optimizer== to set the weights\n- minimizes loss\n\nSigmoid (S-shaped) functions work much better than linear activation functions\n\nRecognizing structures and patterns in data is known as ==feature detection==. Example, the strokes involved in creating the number 5. horizontal line on top, vertical line on left, and backwards C shape.\n\nSo train a model for each of the three features. A fully connected layer (perceptron + act func) to detect horizontal line, vertical line and backwards C. Connect all the 3 fully connected layers, to create a multilayer perceptron to detect a 5. In Pytorch this is done using `Sequential`\n\nBut how do we modify this to increase dimensionality of the outputs? Dont just identify the digit (5 or not) but tell me the digit it is. This is where we need probablity calculation. This is done using `softmax` function. Take the multidimensional output and run it through softmax.\n\nSoftmax gives you an array of probabilities. But we want an array of zeros and ones. to finally identify the digit. RMS error is a bad way to compare this and has high error. People mostly use the ==cross entropy== function.\n\nhttps://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io\n\nHow does the .fit work?\n\n- All neural network fitting schemes uses local optimization. Descend the surface of the loss function. Uses calculus to descend the loss function surface. Compute gradient of loss function wrt any given point on the surface. Then follow that till gradient is zero. Gradient descent algorithm. \n- Downside to local optimization can always give false minima\n\n- Gradient descent algorithm possibly with \"Momentum\" is usually the first choice for optimizers. Sometimes ADAM or RMSProp works better.\n- Recommendation: better to try different optimizers, than mess with config of optimizer you are using.\n- Look into Backpropagation algorithm too, its really beautiful mathematically. OpenAI blog post has a great article. This blog is also very good for ML. Also mentioned 3blue1brown videos -\u003e Look at his deep learning videos.\n- Batchnorm -- normalize the inputs to be within some some range of numbers, so that activation functions dont become unresponsive\n\n2 minute courses -- research topics\nfastAI - courses on YT and notebooks\nfull stack deep learning course YT\nweights and biases YT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Pytorch-Day2":{"title":"","content":"\n### Review\n- A fully connected network does \"non-deep\" learning. It is only by connecting them to create multilayer perceptrons, or deep neural networks, that are capable of \"deep\" learning.\n\n### Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)\n\n- Instead of using Linear layers, they use ==Conv2D== layers. Linear layers tend to flatten the image being process and weight them. Conv2D layer looks at in as a 2D plane.\n- The process takes an array of pixels, and outputs a single number.. So by scanning conv2D layers, you construct a new 2D map. This process is called builing a \"Feature Map\".\n- AlexNet is a famous neural net that improved computer vision that came out in 2013.\n\n*you need to construct these notes with images from the originial slide set*\n\n- This convolution process is trying to identify some \"feature\" in the picture.\n- You usually train a bunch of convolutions for the different features you want to extract. Each of them will generate a new array of information. Each feature you are looking for requires a different \"kernel\" used for convolution. For say 10 features, will give you 10 \"channels\" that tells you about the \"feature\" you were looking for in that image. This blows up the problem size!\n- How to get around this?  Use a Max pooling layer.\n\t- you take a grid of numbers and just choose the max value in the grid. this down samples the image. Higher number means that its a greater presence of the feature you are looking for. So it makes intuitive sense that that it is enough to take max values.\n\n- checking out the \"Deep Dream\" paper from Google.

It serves as a basis to hit all the important requirements from an exercise routine, to optimize health and fitness. A beginner starting out, or an individual who is solely interested in staying fit, and not really training for specialized athletic performance should simply follow the foundational protocol for fitness. If you are trying to be more specific, like train for a marathon, or simply build muscle for asthetics, then the exercise routine required will simply overweight the equivalent protocol for that purpose (eg, weight training for muscular [[hypertrophy]])\n\n## What are the different fitness protocol types?\n\n1. Skill\n2. Speed\n3. Strength\n4. Power (Speed x Strength)\n5. Hypertrophy\n6. Muscular Endurance\n7. Aerobic Endurance\n\t1. Over 30 mins (high heart rate)\n\t2. Over 30 mins (lower heart rate)\n\n## How can a weekly workout be designed to hit all these protocols?\n\n### Day 1: Aerobic Endurance (Low heart rate)\nThe main purpose is to maintain [[Zone 2]] heart rate for an extended period of time. You can get this from rowing, cycling or jogging for 60-75 mins. Alternatively, you can go on a long hike (2-3 hours) to mix it up. If you really find that easy, use a weighted vest or a ruck sack during the long hike.\n\n### Day 2: Hypertrophy - Lower Body\nPrimarily focus on weights and do a heavy volume set to really push legs close to failure on 2-3 sets at least. The main purpose is to target the quads, hamstring and calves. \n\nLeg muscles are very large musicles and working them out early in the week sets up for better metabolism and hormones throughout the week. But make sure that legs are not too tired from Day 1 exercise.\n\n### Day 3: Heat and Cold Cycling  (Recovery)\nThe purpose here is to activate various mechanisms involved in hot and cold therapy for which there is a lot of material out there. But essentially, do a 20 min sauna followed by a 45-50F ice bath. Do not go colder on this until you are sure you will not get hypothermia. This will also accelerate recovery from a leg workout the previous day. Maybe go for a walk to ensure that you hit a target of 200m [[Zone 2]] cardio in the week.\n\n### Day 4: Hypertrophy - Upper Body\nDo a weight training session for the torso, where you will do bench / shoulder presses, bent over rows, pull ups, etc. Ensure that you getting both pushing and pulling (or eccentric and concentric) exercises. Do a good heavy volume set that will build your chest and back muscles. Note that we are not working out biceps / triceps etc here.\n\n### Day 5:  Aerobic/Muscular Endurance (High heart rate)\nDo a run, row or cycle where your heart rate is much higher than Zone 2 and is typically about 80% of your heart rate maximum (calculated as 220-age). So for a 40 year old, that would be a sustained heart rate of ~145bpm.\n\n\n---\n\n### Day 6: Speed, Strength, Power (High intensity, Max HR, 2nd leg day)\nDo a [[HIIT]] style training with a focus on working out the legs specifically. One simple example is you can sprint with maximum effort for 30s and rest for 10s, and repeat this for 5 times at least. The goal is to do explosive exercises for your legs generally, and keep the volume low. But you will aim to hit absolute maximum heart rate (~180bpm for a 40 year old) for at least a few minutes, till you feel your heart wanting to explode out of your chest. With the focus on legs, this will serve as a 2nd lower body workout too.\n\n### Day 7: Hypertrophy - Arms, Calves, Neck\nThis is the second day of hypertrophy for upper body with an emphasis on biceps, triceps, calves, and neck. Yes, neck muscles are very important to be strong too. It may save you from whiplash and maybe even death.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE]\n\u003e Concepts are few, but methods are many\n\u003e *Andy Galpin*\n\n## What are some general training guidelines useful for this?\n\n- For a 1 hour workout session, do about 10 mins of warmup followed by 50 mins of ==hard work==.\n- For muscle work, do it twice a week for upper and lower body. First time, do heavy weights and high intensity. Second time, do moderate weights but [[HIIT]] style.\n- When picking exercises, use both push and pull types of exercies. Loading on both concentric and eccentric motions are important.\n- Use an alternating weight strategy every month, to keep it simple and reduce injury.\n\t- Odd months : Lower reps, heavy weights -\u003e more sets, long rest times (2-4mins)\n\t- Even months: Higher reps, lower weights -\u003e fewer sets, short rest times (0.5-2mins)\n- Limit your exercises to only those you **can** do, and do it **==WITH PERFECT FORM==**\n\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/literature/P-Resistance-Training-Patrick":{"title":"Resistance training for time efficiency, body composition, and maximum hypertrophy with Brad Schoenfeld","content":"\n### Why should we be resistance training?\n\n- If you were to pick one form of exercise, it should be resistance training\n- It gives all benefits of cardio in addition to:\n\t- Muscle and bone strength\n\t\t- Osteoporosis (esp for women) is a possibility with age\n\t\t- Resistance training makes muscle pull on the bone, and strengthens the bone\n\t\t- Weight bearing exercise strengthens bone, not other forms of exercise\n\t\t- Cycling, swimming, and other forms of cardio does not help bone density, maybe running is ok to some extent\n\t\t- Compound motions like squats, rows, presses, pushups are very helpful for bone density\n\t\t- Even \u003e70 yr olds see massive improvements in muscle strength when they start lifting, in 8-12 weeks, even if they have never training before.\n\t\t\t- But always start early. Getting back what you lost is very hard.\n\t\t\t- Always maintain your muscle mass.\n\t\t\t- Women in particular should start early, but its never too late.\n\t\t\t- Early is at least teens and twenties.\n\t\t\t- Create a \"bone bank\" where you can invest early into bone density. You can stave off bone density loss in old age, but it is better to have a good reserve to start with\n\t\t- Resistance training does not stunt growth, this is a myth, there is no evidence for this\n\t\t- Even kids 6-8 yrs can start resistance training, and helps with bone density. But they should be supervised, and not get themselves injured. But soccer and basketball are much more prone to injury.\n\t\t- There is research to show that 6-8 years old kids can do weight training (look this up).\n\t\t\t- Start with lighter loads\n\t\t\t- Make it enjoyable\n\t- Posture improvement\n\n### Body recomposition with resistance training\n\n- Any form of exercise (cardio or resistance) isnt always the best way to drop fat mass, but instead you should restrict calorie intake majorly. Exercise is adjunct at that point. \n- Cardio is more for increasing energy expenditure.\n- It is important to combine resistance training with calorie restriction to contribute to weight loss. If you do only cardio and no resistance training, you will lose both muscle and fat. No recomposition will happen. Resistance training maintains muscle mass.\n- The more weight you have to lose, the easier it is to recomp.\n- If you have been training for a long time, then it is harder to recomp. Noob gains is a real thing.\n- If you want to bulk up, then you cannot guarantee that you will maximize muscle. You need to be at equal calorie needs or at a slight surplus.\n\n### Nutrition requirements for muscle mass\n- Can I have plenty of protein intake while meeting calorie deficit, but not do resistance training?\n\t- No. You have to do resistance training.\n\t- but it really depends, maybe if you are very obese then you will lose fat first\n\t- But even if you are normal, you need a lot of protein to maintain muscle\n- Need 1.6-1.8g / kg which is about 2X the RDA. No really downsides, no liver damage, etc.\n\t- This number is calculated for people who are lean - about 15-20% body fat. If you are obese, then you need to target the lower weight for protein intake calculations.\n\t- Protein is very diffcult to store as body fat.\n\t- Older people need even more protein due to reduced anabolism. They need more leucine to kickstart the muscle growth.\n- Whole foods are the best for protein intake, but protein shakes are ok if you are not meeting your requirements.\n- Dont need leucine supplements if you are taking in animal based protein. They are quality proteins that are rich in leucine.\n- 4oz of chicken = 30g of protein\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/permanent/-A-Simple-Format-To-Distil-What-You-Learn":{"title":"üî≠ A Simple Format To Distil What You Learn","content":"\n# üî≠ A Simple Format To Distil What You Learn\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/a-simple-format-to-distil-what-you-learn-186d10c28a7)\n[Read Original](https://designinsight.substack.com/p/090?r=222kot)\n\n## Highlights\n\nA structure would make writing the [[newsletter]] easier as I could work within the constraints of the headings to guide what I wrote about.

Trying to capture every single thought as a note you will need forever\n- You think that every single thought, idea, or concept is equally important and that it is best to file everything away for when you need it. In other words, you treat every note as a permanent note.\n- This creates a large quantity of notes, that you cannot link to other notes in your system in any reasonable way.\n- Such notes cannot be found later, and the complexity involved in remembering the existance of the note makes the system messy.\n \n### 2. You take only project related notes\n- When you decide on the project that you want to work on, you collect information required for the project only. This means that for every project, you have to restart the process, and there is no reuse from your readings on past projects. This is inefficient.\n- You come across ideas not relevant to current projects so you skip taking notes on them. This is a valuable loss of insight that might be highly application and even translate into a great idea for a future project.\n\n### 3. You treat every note as temporary and never convert them into meaningful notes\n- You treat every note as a fleeting note. You write ideas down on a scratch paper, and these pile up when you dont process them in any way, and soon you will forget their context and significance.\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n[[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]\n[[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Conventional-writing-methods-are-flawed-right-from-the-start":{"title":"Conventional writing methods are flawed right from the start","content":"\nThe conventional academic research workflow suggests that you first pick a topic to work on, do the necessary research, think about creative solutions, and consolidate your findings in writing.\n\nThere are drawbacks to this method:\n1.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#9a52fd13-5cd9-4c73-9d6f-32f3da7a6bc2) The Barbell Method takes this into account by integrating your reading habit into your [[personal knowledge management]] with two steps:\n\n1. Read the book. Read swiftly but don‚Äôt skip any parts. Mark all the passages that stand out and contain useful, interesting or inspiring information.\n2. Read the book a second time. But now you read the marked parts only. This time you make notes, connect them to past notes ([[zettelkasten]]) and think about what you‚Äôve read. Make mindmaps, drawings, bullet points ‚Äì everything that helps you to think more clearly.

[‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-barbell-method-of-reading-zettelkasten-method-18707935ab2#b4c493c0-d685-45aa-b530-0451ad6bc581)\n\nThe first step of the Barbell Method of Reading is just reading. That is a shallow kind of processing that suffices to understand what is easy to understand. You are probing the text and can later decide what you should do with it. You decide on a part-by-part basis.\n\nA text consists of four different types of parts:\n- Useful and difficult to understand. \n\t- You want to process these parts heavily for understanding and exploitation. \n\t- Mark these for later.\n- Useful and easy to understand. \n\t- You want to process these parts heavily for exploitation. \n\t- Mark these for later.\n- Not useful but difficult to understand. \n\t- You actually don‚Äôt want to process these parts but you don‚Äôt know if they are useful. Sharpen your mental theeth with them and then ignore them after you found out that they are not useful.\n- Not useful and easy to understand. \n\t- Ignore these.

They either sit staring at a blank page wondering what to write.\n2. They put so much effort into one piece of content but really have no idea if it will resonate or not with their audience.\n\nBut writers who take a bottom‚Äôs up approach to content creation discover:\n- Their ideas are clarified further the more they write about them.\n- They never start from a blank page because ideas get promoted upwards from tweets to essays to articles and beyond.\n- They always have a good idea of what resonates because ideas have already been tested down the ladder.\n- Their content creation feels effortless because each level builds on the next and the positive signal provides motivation to keep creating.

If you already have an idea it‚Äôs not hard to get it to that next step of 250 words.\n- They are easily consumable. You‚Äôre not asking people to leave the platforms (which Twitter hates) and they can be consumed in mostly less than a minute [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-bottom-s-up-approach-to-writing-that-99-guarantees-a-success-186ad62d672#44f0c1bc-f545-46a2-82fd-2175dc1af2cf)\n I‚Äôve found leaving about a 2-week gap between the original tweet and a follow-up essay creates the best results.

Writing does not merely put down in words, the thoughts that are in the mind. Writing *is* thinking.\n\nHere are some advantages of writing while reading or learning:\n1. You will feel more engaged with the material you are learning\n2. You will learn to differentiate actual good ideas from ones that only sound good to you at that moment. Some notes you write down will only become great ideas in the context of a future project you will work on.\n3. You will be actively reading knowing that you will have to reforumulate the ideas you just read into your own notes, ==in your own words==, when you create permanent notes.\n4. Re-iterating ideas in a written note will allow you to phase your idea in a context that makes sense to you, and by linking it to your existing ideas, you are more likely to remember it later.\n5. You will be more deliberate in your choice of reading material, knowing that it should likely relate to your other notes, or projects that you are working on. You will have to invest the time to create meaningful notes from what you read, or risk losing your thoughts and ideas from that material forever.\n\n---\n# References\n\n- [[permanent/Value of an idea depends on its context]]\n- [[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow]]\n- [[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]\n- [[permanent/work strategies for successful writing]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Thevenin-voltage-as-a-figure-of-merit-for-current-source-performance":{"title":"Thevenin voltage as a figure of merit for current source performance","content":"\nThe open-circuit equivalent voltage given by the Thevenin equivalent representation is the figure of merit for a current source.

Did your manager tell you about the project, or did you kick it off with a team? Was the project hand-delivered to you as an assignment, or was it something you figured out?\n- What was your first interaction with the project, and how did you feel going into it? Were you intimated or excited? Eager or annoyed? Why?\n- What was the first thing you did? Not the first thing the team did, but what did you do once you learned about the project? Did you schedule meetings with stakeholders, look through past research, write down everything you knew about the work to come, or something else\n- What was the first (or second) challenge you encountered? How did you feel? What did you do to work through the challenge with others?\n- How did the project typically progress? Did you need to rally the team together regularly, were regular meetings booked by a product manager for you, or did you set up consistent design critiques for the team to give you feedback? Did you do research, and if so, who scheduled it? How did all of that work feel for you?\n- Were there any notable challenges you faced during the project? Call these out! Was there a disagreement between you and someone else? Was there a time you dropped something or failed to meet expectations? How did you recover from those things?\n- Where did the project end up? What, if anything, would you have done differently?

When consuming media (books, articles, blogs, podcasts), take down literature notes. Always write it in your own words\n\t3. Remember to write down the reference to the media being consumed\n2. Go through all the thoughts you have collected thus far, and create permanent notes.\n\t1. One idea per note\n\t2. Keep it short, concise and as general as possible so that the original context is not needed to understand what this note intends to say.\n\t3. Think about how the idea links to other ideas already present as permanent notes and make links to them\n\t4. Make sure that you will find this note later by linking to it from an index, or from another note that is tied to an index\n\t5.

Look for missing links, generate questions or insights from your notes\n\t2. Follow the path of greatest interest and insight\n\t3. In due course, you would have developed enough insights and related notes around a particular topic\n4. Convert your notes into a draft article\n\t1.

You will encounter ideas that seem irrelevant to the problem you are working on. Nevertheless make a note of the ideas you encounter.\n\t2. Although the extra time spent on seemingly irrelevant note seems wasteful, the power of this method does lie in building up a large interlinked web of ideas\n\t3. You will follow different lines of thought at once, so with this method, many different lines of thought will develop concurrently.

They have to discharge slowly through the body-source and body-drain junctions through very slow recombination processes.\n\n## What is the current solution?\n\nFloating body device is made to have faster charge removal mechanisms from the body by increasing the rate of recombination in the body-source / body-drain junctions by engineering the interface to have higher trap states that can provide for extra recombination sites.\n\n## What is the problem with this solution?\n\nRecombination effects are very random and can take very long or very short times to complete. Which means that the LNA has great variablility in its settling time. The recombination rates change by about two orders of magnitude from measurements of a body contacted LNA device. This is causing product failures.\n\n## What is the new solution?\n\nFloating body and body-contacted devices are exactly the same, save for the presence of a body terminal. The reason we cannot use a body-contact LNA device in an LNA is due to linearity and noise issues (from shot noise in the body contact).\n\n\u003e [! Important]\n\u003e A body-contact device with it's body terminal floating, behaves like a floating body device.\n\nHere is the main idea:\n\n- During the switching event in a LNA from one gain state to another, keep the body-terminal at ground potential.\n- After the settling time spec window (~1 $\\mu$s), the body-terminal can be floated to mimic the performance of a floating body device.\n\nThis ensures that there is rapid charge removal from the body of the device during the switching event, enabling the device to settle quickly. After the switching event, the device should provide the performance of a floating-body device which is optimal for LNA use.\n\nWith this in place, there is no use to use special low-latency devices which have engineered traps in the device. Any regular floating body device will do, as long as it has an equivalent body-contacted device.\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.309694227Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Working-principle-of-a-Current-Mirror":{"title":"Working principle of a Current Mirror","content":"A [[permanent/Current Mirror]] copies the golden reference current $I_{ref}$ generated by a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit.\n\n## Circuit Diagram\n\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\n## Explanation\n\n- The purpose of transistor Q1 is to generate an output voltage at its base that is proportional to the input current at the collector.

If they are learning piano, just playing 10 minutes everyday is much better than trying to teach them to become better or perfect. Just the very act of doing will make them better.\n\nOne tell tale sign that you're getting numb, is when you start putting yourself out there for the world to see. It shows that you have stopped worrying about what other people think. You are getting numb.\n\nOn this note, radio producer Ira Glass has a beautiful quote:\n\u003e[!quote] All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.‚Äù\n\n### References\n---\n[[permanent/lower bound on time to get a task done]]\n[[permanent/treating music composition as a routine chore]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.313694283Z","tags":null},"/permanent/impact-of-cgd-on-transit-frequency":{"title":"impact of cgd on transit frequency","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.313694283Z","tags":null},"/permanent/improving-your-opportunities-for-luck":{"title":"improving your opportunities for luck","content":"\nYou can deliberately work on increasing the number of chance encounters, thereby improving opportunities for [[luck]].

It is much more applicable to rfic.io. It is too hard for me to address all  hardware engineers.\n- Can I show how RF data analysis scripts with scikit-RF should be git controlled?\n\t- what kind of code snippets writtin in scikit-rf can be most reused across projects?\n- Address matlab users and show that git is integrated into matlab. Link some articles showing how it should be used.\n- SKILL scripts can be another area to be addressed.\n- Apparently PCB files have been revision controlled using git- link some articles.\n---\n\nGit is so prevalent in the software engineering world yet so few hardware engineers know of it, or use it effectively in their work. But hardware engineers do write and use software code in their day to day work, to do data analysis with python, build various simulation systems with Matlab's Toolboxes, write SKILL code for Virtuoso or perform lab automation with Labview or C-sharp.\n\nRevision controlled code can greatly benefit all these situations to maintain functioning and high quality code that can be reused in the future while making continuous improvements for efficieny, features and accuracy. This usually has payback in terms of getting work done more quickly and correctly in the future.\n\nOne fundamental pain point in a lot of these applications is that git is not built in to the development environments used by engineers. Another reason is the hesitation of hardware engineers to use the command line for doing anything. In such cases, I'd argue that a GUI based version control system is just as fine, as long as the benefits of version control are made available to hardware engineers. To this end, I would recommend getting started with Github desktop as a GUI tool.\n\n\u003c At some point you will have to explain what git and github actually is \u003e\n\nBut what about propreitary information? We do not want to put that up on Github for all to see! That is a valid concern that should cross all our minds as we work on proprietary technologies in our companies. After trade secrets are what pays our bills! \n\nThere are two solutions for this:\n1. If you are not worried about collaboration, and want to version control just the code you develop, then running a git repository entirely local to your computer is the answer. This way, you will not have to sync anything to a central server and risk exposing important information.\n2. If you do have the need to collaborate, then it is worthwhile checking if your organization has a github enterprise server setup for your use. If not, you can request your IT department to see if you can get one set up. This way, you will not have to use github.com as your remote repository server.\n\nLet us look at a rather common use case of git for a hardware engineer. Assume you have a CSV data file that contains measurements of some hardware in the lab, and you are using MATLAB to process the data and perform some analysis.\n\n\u003c You need to work on some code examples  \u003e\n\nHere are the steps you need to do:\n\n- Initialize a git repo with Git GUI for this codebase\n- Check in some files and push to remote repository\n- Make some code updates and commit-push again\n- Show commit history\n- Demonstrate branching and merging\n- Demonstrate forking\n- Making releases and tagging\n\nInvestigate other git flows - command line based, VScode plugin... does Matlab acutally integrate Git now?\n\n\u003c Put in some resources to go deeper into git / github. There are plenty of oneline resources I dont have to go into \u003e\n\nThe main concent behind git is to check in code, and not acyutally check in data. Github has a 50MB file limit that is sufficient to hold about a million lines of code. While, it is possible to store data in Github, it is not intended for that. However, as long as the file size limitations are not a constraint, there is nothing acutally preventing you from version controlling data files. \n\nAnyone in the corporate environment would wonder if Git is useful for word and powerpoint documentation. I wouldn't really recommend using it for such an application since Microsoft's OneDrive integration does provide version control that works much better for something like this.\n\nAlso, if you are ever interested in participating in open source projects, git is something you should know.

It's not until my early 30s, that I actually realized that I should be contributing to a 401k all along, and have been putting away as much as i can ever since.\n\t2. It is said, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is now\"? If like me, you haven't got started yet, there is no better time to start than now. Starting late means that you have to put away even more per month to reach your retirement goals. (start_investing_early.png)\n2. . Minimize your taxes\n\t1. By contributing to a 401k, you will pay lesser taxes to the government in any given year due to what is called a \"pre-tax deduction\". Let's look at an example of what that means. \n\t2. Lets say you make \\$100,000 in a year, and say you effectively pay  20% or \\$20,000 in taxes. Assuming you contributed 10% of your income to a 401k, or $10,000, that means 10% of your income is deducted from your income *before* taxes are calculated. Which means that you pay taxes on $100K-10K = $90K. At a 20% effective tax rate, you would be paying $18K in taxes instead of $20K without 401k contributions. So by contributing to a 401k, you've really made yourself $2K extra by not forking it over to the government.  \n\t3. In reality, your tax rate might be lower after you contribute to a 401k. Lets say you only pay 18% effective taxes, so you pay $16.2K in taxes. You have now saved $3.8K in taxes. And effectively, you are paying only 16.2K/100K = 16.2% effective tax rate instead of 20%. \n\t4. If you are fortunate to make enough, or live well below your means to sock away the maximum allowed contribution to a 401k, which is $22,500 in 2023, then this is the amount that you should contribute to get the maximum tax savings in any given year. \n\t5. If you are over the age of 50, you  get to contribute another $7500 as \"catch-up contributions\" for a maximum of $30,000\n3. Get your matching contributions\n\t1. Several employers match the 401k contributions of their employees up to a certain limit. For example, your employer might say that they match $1 for every $1 contributed up to 5% of your salary. \n\t2. So if you make $100,000, and contribute 10% (or $10K) to your 401k in the year, the company will match every dollar up to 5% of your salary, or $5K. In this example, you will get an extra $5K into your 401k contribution. \n\t3. In reality, many companies use a tiered system where they contribute lets say $1 for every $1 up to $3000, $0.5 for every $1 thereafter, which makes the calculation more complex, but in essense you still get more money into your 401k by getting the company match. \n\t4. What is more amazing about the company match is that it is not limited by the $22,500 401k limit mentioned earlier. The company's contributions will help you save more than the 401k limit. So if the company match was an extra $5K,  your annual contributions will go up to (22.5+5)=27.5K or (30+5)=35K if you're older than 50. Now, there is still another option that allows you to reach $66,000 in annual 401k contributions, stick around to find out.\n\t5. Should you not contribute to a 401k if you don't have a company match? No, the company match is just an added benefit. Contributing to a 401k still does save on taxes and is worth doing just for that sake. But if you do have a company match, at least contribute enough to get the free money!\n4. Save at least 10% of your income\n\t1. Fundamentally, the contribution rates comes down to how much you can afford to put away, and what your monthly expenses are. So it would be best to first examine how much money you need every month to cover your needs from mortgage or rent, to groceries, childcare, medical, or discretionary expenses. \n\t2. Even if you do enroll in a 401k but don't get around to actually setting the percentage deduction, your employer will most likely auto-deduct a default percentage from your paycheck and this is often in the range of 2%. This is a really good move in my opinion, because we will immediately start saving small amounts of money even if inertia gets the better of us and we don't get around to setting percentages in a 401k. \n\t3. If you do get around it, and if your monthy budget permits, it is generally recommended that you save at least 10% of your paycheck in a 401k. Obviously, the more the better, but that should be a good start.\n5. Enroll in Continuous Increase Program\n\t1. As time rolls on, you want to make sure that you increase the amount of money you save in a 401k. For this reason, many employers do provide a continuous increase program where you can set what % your 401k contribution should increase every year. A good idea here is to set it to annually increase 1-2%, so that in about 5 years you are now saving 15-20% of your paycheck and well on your way to financial freedom.\n6. Invest in Diversified, Low Cost Mutual Funds\n\t1. The simple and efficient option is to invest in target date funds. These are mutual funds that are generally well diversified, which means that they hold a broad spectrum of stocks and bonds so that you don't put all your eggs in one basket.  They also have a low expense ratio, which means that it costs you very little to buy and hold this fund till your retirement date. For example, if you decide to retire in 2060, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) is an excellent choice from Vanguard. It has returned over 8% on the average over the last 10 years, and it has an expense ratio of 0.08%, which means that you will not give up much of your investment returns in the form of fees. Simply buying and holding such a fund for a long time will ensure that you are underway to building a secure nest egg.\n\t2. Create your own 3-fund portfolio\n\t\t1. If you don't have access to a target date fund in your list of available choices in your 401k, you can create your own by buying the right mix of index funds in your 401k. Index funds hold a large number of individual stock holdings and gives you a diversified portfolio. For example, to emulate the 2060 retirement fund, you can simply buy 54% of a total stock market index fund, 36% of a total international index fund, and 10% of a total bond fund. This distribution of percentages is called an Asset Allocation. And, a good rule of thumb is to set your bond holdings to (Age-10) and allocate the rest to a mix of total and international stock funds. So if you are in your 20s, holding anywhere between 10-15% in bonds is a good choice.\n\t\t2.  Adding in variations with tilts and REITs\n\t\t\t1. If you want to get even more granular in your investment choices, you may choose to \"tilt\" your portfolio towards certain high risk, high reward choices. For example, you can choose to tilt towards smaller companies which provide more growth but at the cost of more fluctuations over time. In other words, it is more risky and volatile. You can choose to overweight your portfolio with a mutual fund like Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund (VSMAX) which focuses on smaller companies.\n\t\t\t2. Or you could choose to add some real estate investments in your portfolio by holding what are called REITS (or Real Estate Investment Trusts) which allows you to invest in mostly commercial real estate. Many people do choose to add REITs in their portfolio, because it is somewhat unrelated to stocks and can provide good balance and diversification in a portfolio. An example of a low cost REIT is Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX).\n7. Avoid Withdrawing from a 401k\n\t1. So now you've invested and grown your money for many years in a 401k. But when can you access it? According to IRS rules in 2023, you will be able to withdraw your money penalty free only when you are 59.5 years old. Pulling out your money any earlier than that will result in a 10% penalty for withdrawal, unless you satisfy the IRS exceptions to this rule. So if you are planning to retire earlier than 59.5, make sure that you have funds outside of your 401k, till you are old enough to withdraw penalty free from your 401k\n\t2. 401k loans\n\t\t1. Assuming withdrawal is not an option due to the penalties involved, but life circumstances require you to pull out some money for emergency expenses, you have the option to take a loan out of your 401k. This depends on your employer too, but typically you can pull out up to 50% of your savings up to $50,000 in a given year. You will have to pay that borrowed money back, with interest, within 5 years of taking the loan. You don't pay early withdrawal penalties this way, unless you default on your 401k loan, or quit your current employment in which case you will have to pay it back on a much shorter time frame.\n8. Invest in the after-tax 401k\n\t1. If you do have a really good source of income, the IRS does allow you to make what are called \"After-Tax 401k\" contributions up to $66,000 in 2023, which includes your original $22.5K traditional 401k and any company matching dollars. These contributions do not help you with reducing taxes like a traditional 401k, however.\n\t2. If there is no tax benefit, then why would you invest in this? The reason is that any earnings on after-tax 401k are not taxed till you actually withdraw from it, at which time you might be in a lower tax bracket. As they say, \"taxes deferred is taxes saved\"\n\t3. Some employers do allow you to convert after-tax contributions to a Roth 401k, which means that your earnings can grow and be distributed completely tax free!\n\t4. This can start getting complicated, so if you would like to know more about traditional, roth and after-tax 401ks, do let me know in the comments below for a future video.\n\nI hope you learned something new in this video.

We cant store it, we can't compound it. It's use it or lose it. We trade our time for money at our jobs, but what if you can spend money to get more time? Instead, use your time to learn something new, exercise, build relationships, relax - or... make this youtube video. Apart from time, there are more reasons why you should not do everything yourself.\n- some things need an expert to get done properly\n- it may be beyond your current physical ability\n- you just don't enjoy doing it\n- you may risk hurting yourself\n\nIn this video, we'll talk about 6 ways in which you can buy back your time with money. To save you time with this video, checkout the timestamps below to quickly navigate as you would like.\n\n- Housecleaning\n\t- For the longest time, I was resisting getting help on this one and did everything myself. I told myself that I am not that busy or that entitled to clean up after myself, then I convinced myself that no cleaning service can match my OCD-infused levels of ultra-cleanliness\n\t- As it turns out none of this is true. I finally came around to admitting that I needed the help given that we have children and two full time jobs, and that cleaners are super professional at what they do and generally do a good job. I realized that I am just being a control freak over this whole cleaning matter. It dawned on me that, not only do I spend the time cleaning, I spend time recovering energy from my cleaning work. It was time to hire someone to clean - but how much does it really cost?\n\t- House cleaning services typically run 20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. You can get quotes from cleaning companies in your area. If you've never got your housed professionally cleaned before, they might insist that you get a deep cleaning first -  which can run you about 300-400. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty and how much you want to spend on the service. Or, you can even get just deep cleanings done once in a few months, where things like blinds, fans and refridgerators get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about 200-500 depending on the size of your house.\n\t- This might be too expensive for some people, that's totally understandable. In that case, get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won't weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. \n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Running the vacuum cleaner around the house\n\t\t- Wiping a countertop\n\t\t- Dusting some surfaces with a mask on.\n- Home and car maintenance\n\t- If you're one of those people who absolutely love to do-it-yourself, and derive happiness from it, hey, good on you, you're going to save a lot of money, and have a good time while doing so! \n\t- However, if home and car upkeep is not your jam, then you're gonna have to pay your way out of it. When it comes to home maintenance, some things can cost an arm and a leg (and your firstborn -- just kidding), and some stuff is relatively inexpensive, so let's go through some of them.\n\t\t- Lawn care -- this is going to cost you like 50-100 bucks per mow depending on your lot size, and where you live in the united states, but if you dont enjoy doing this yourself, its fairly simple to have someone to come in to take care of it.\n\t\t- Pest control -- this one costs about 100 / visit and it is probably sufficient to have some one come to take a look every couple of months or so, and I don't believe anyone particularly loves dealing with pests, so forking out some cash may be worth your while\n\t\t- Plumbing -- I have a simple rule. If I can't unblock a drain by snaking it, call a plumber. I am fairly dumb when it comes to plumbing and things get messy real quick, so i'd rather have some one come over. It's hard to give a cost estimate because the quote to fix will depend on how extensive your plumbing issues are. So I'll just leave that with a (shrug)\n\t\t- Car care -- I always get tire rotations and oil changes done at a local garage, because it is much easier to do when the car is on a hoist. And I don't want to be responsible for proper disposal of engine oil. Technically, brake pads are rather easy to do yourself, but getting a professional to do it gives you the peace of mind that the car is still safe to drive.\n\t\t- Apart from this, there is a whole lot out there like tree removal, plumbing, electrical, fences, windown cleaning, roofing, HVAC, gutter cleaning... which is too much for this video\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Walking through tall grass\n\t\t- Enjoying short cut grass\n\t\t- Pulling weeds, trimming hedges\n- Laundry Service\n\t- If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for. How it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.\n\t- The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you. \n\t- If you have a washer and dryer at home, then you can run loads whenever possible, and couple folding with something like watching TV and make it a family effort to knock it out of the park. At home, when I get the kids involved in folding and putting away their clothes, stuff goes super quickly. So I've never had the need for a laundry service, but hey everyone's needs are different and your milage may vary!\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Carrying laundry basket\n\t\t- Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials\n\t\t- Folding clothes, putting on hangars\nBy the way, if you're enjoying this video, do click the little hitchhiking sign down below, and consider subscribing. Thanks!\n- Cooking\n\t- This is something we have to do for the rest of our lives, so it's worth figuring this out. Eating out, while making the healthiest food choices can definitely save you time, good quality food, even if readily available around you, can be very expensive over the long term. I do have friends who say that the overhead of buying groceries, preparing food, dealing with the ensuing kitchen clean up, etc, is simply not for them, and argue that the expense of eating out is totally worth it.\n\t- An alternative to eating out all the time is to have pre-prepared meal kits delivered at your doorstep, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to prepare your meals. There are companies such as Hello Fresh, or Fresh n Lean that ship to your door step, and you get a variety of diet choices like vegan, paleo, or keto. The cost per serving is typically between $10-$20, and while this calculus might work out for some people, it is simply not an option for those with larger families, in my humble opinion.\n\t- Another option is to get Pre-prepared meals from places like Costco or similar grocery stores, where you get a pizza that you simply pop in the oven, or meals that you can quickly cook in the microwave in a few minutes. The preparation time is much lesser, and you can quickly put some food on the table. Cost-wise this is more affordable than all the previous options, and might be a decent option for those with families.\n\t- The final option is to prepare all your meals yourself from scratch, and is the most cost effective and healthy but most time consuming. However, you can save time by setting aside a day on the weekend to food prep for the entire week. It can be a great time to bond with family. Save time by reusing pots and pans, cleaning as you go and cooking for multiple days while the oven is hot. When food is ready, pack them into lunch boxes and stow them away in the fridge.\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Cutting vegetables and meat\n\t\t- Lighting a stovetop\n\t\t- Stirring food\n\t\t- Cutting bread\n- Commute\n\t- As of 2019, Americans spend about 27.6 mins each way in their commute on average, and about 10% spend an hour or more. Minimizing commute time can make a significant improvement in your quality of life, and get you back a big portion of your day.\n\t- But to minimize your work commute, you will need to live closer to your workplace, and depending on your industry and location, this might actually end up costing you more in mortgage or rent. The cost can be controlled by choosing a smaller or less fancy place to live, but this is a real tradeoff we have to make. The silver lining is that you will pay lesser in transportation costs, may even eliminate the need to own a car, or simply be able to use public transportation.\n\t- If you are lucky enough to have the option for remote work, then none of this applies - so let's move on to the next one.\n\t- **B-ROLL**\n\t\t- Getting in car and driving away\n\t\t- Pulling up into driveway and getting out\n\t\t- Fast forward video of driving through traffic\n- Child care\n\t- I've got to say up front that time spent with your child is priceless, and is something you can never outsource. However, every so often we could all use a little extra help around the house so that you can actually spend quality, uninterrupted time with your child and be there for them at the age they need you most. For this, you can actually hire what is called a Mothers helper. So care.com (not sponsoring this video) has an article that describes what a mothers helper does .\n\t\t- Do dishes while you play with the kids\n\t\t- Run some errands\n\t\t- Play with older children, while moms tend to the younger child\n\t\t- Help decorate the house, or wrap gifts\n\t\t- Help with homework\n\t- Typically mothers helpers are \"baby sitters in training\" - so that they can help watch kids while the parents are around. They are typically less expensive overall than hiring a full time nanny. But since I only learned of mothers helpers more recently, and my kids are much older now, I've never had the chance to actually hire them. If you did, leave your experience in the comments below. That would greatly help out- thanks.\n\t- \n\nTo summarize, here are the six services that allow you to buy back your time so that you can deploy it in the most meaningful ways in your life. \n\n\n\nFood:\nhttps://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-prepared-meal-delivery-service/","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.317694339Z","tags":null},"/projects/youtube/YouTube-Introduction":{"title":"YouTube Introduction","content":"\nHow do we provide value?\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.317694339Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/An-Academic-Workflow-Zotero-Obsidian-by-Alexandra-Phelan-Medium":{"title":"","content":"\n# An Academic Workflow: Zotero \u0026 Obsidian | by Alexandra Phelan | Medium\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-by-alexandra-phelan-medium-18725103e39)\n[Read Original](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-56bf918d51ab)\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e It‚Äôs a waste of time to collect resources and do nothing with them.

He would study the texture of them, and unearth the various places within the swishes where patterns may secretly reside. And once he discovered the image that emerged as a result of connecting these patterns, he filled in the gaps with intentional brushstrokes that would form the beautiful landscapes he was famous for painting.

Then focus on getting good.\n* don‚Äôt seek feedback. If people offer you advice, shut it out. It‚Äôs not that feedback is bad, or that advice is terrible, it‚Äôs that none of it is useful until you‚Äôre numb.\n* whenever a friend asks me for advice on blogging, I tell them to just publish a post a week. I try not to give them advice about blog topics or writing techniques,\n* when you‚Äôre getting your kid started in sports, do what is necessary to get them numb before you focus on improving their technique.\n* When managing a content marketing team, get your podcast host to produce episodes at a weekly cadence before iterating for marketing impact.\n* if aforementioned new podcast host/producer is willing to share her work on her personal social media accounts, then she‚Äôs likely numb enough or proud enough of her work to be able to iterate effectively. It's only then that I can switch to more aggressive feedback. But not before.\n* Radio producer Ira Glass has a famous quote where he says:\n* All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.‚Äù\n* Get numb, then get good.\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.317694339Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/How-Food-Powers-Your-Body":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories](url)\n* Author: James Somers\n* Publisher: The New Yorker\n* Published Date: 2022-10-25\n* Tags: \n\n## Highlights\n* Szent-Gy√∂rgyi is often credited with saying that life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest;\n* Glucose is like a chemical shipping container. It is an ideal electron transporter, in part because it is high-capacity, conveniently shaped, and easily opened up. It‚Äôs also unusually soluble, which means that it travels well through the bloodstream.\n* Our brains, whose parts have especially unpredictable energy requirements‚Äîas neurons fire, they create spikes in demand‚Äîdepend almost exclusively on glucose for energy.\n* When glucose reaches our cells, it is‚Äîunlike a shipping container‚Äîdismantled systematically. A series of reactions strips its highest-energy electrons and uses them to form a small ‚Äúcarrier molecule‚Äù known as an NADH. If glucose is like a shipping container, then NADHs are like delivery trucks. The process of loading the electrons into the trucks is called glycolysis.\n* When glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen, it is known as fermentation. If your muscles are pushed to their limit and there‚Äôs not enough oxygen in your bloodstream, your cells ferment glucose as a stopgap measure for energy production.\n* Oxygen is so hungry for electrons‚Äîits outer shell needs only two more to get a complete set‚Äîthat in effect it pulls them all the way through the Krebs cycle, which is the real powerhouse of our metabolism.\n* energy-rich electrons are peeled off and loaded up onto yet more NADHs‚Äîfar more than in glycolysis alone.\n* mitochondria‚Äîstructures believed to have descended from a free-floating bacterium that was ingested by one of our ancestors long ago and co√∂pted.\n* A mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which create a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane like rabbits poking their heads through a hedge. These proteins capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n* At the moment that the protein pulls each electron inward, it also disgorges the proton, pushing it from the internal chamber to the external one. This extrusion happens everywhere across the membrane. The result is that many positively charged protons build up outside, separated by a wall from the negatively charged electrons held inside. An electrical field comes into being. Quite literally, each mitochondrion becomes a battery, waiting to discharge.\n* The electrical field generated by the process, he explains, has a strength of around thirty million volts per metre‚Äî‚Äúequivalent to a bolt of lightning across every square nanometre of membrane.‚Äù\n* Pulled by the electrical current, they desperately want to get back to the inside of the mitochondrion, where the electrons are. Their only way back, however, is to squeeze through tiny mushroom-shaped conduits that litter the membrane. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are actually little turbines. Seen in minute detail through electron microscopes, they resemble waterwheels; the protons turn them as they pass.\n* each turn of the wheel assembles a molecule of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP‚Äîthe energy currency of our cells.\n* By dint of its structure, ATP is extremely willing to give up its energy, but it is prevented from doing so by a few precisely controllable molecular speed bumps‚Äîlike\n* each molecule of ATP is endowed with a standard amount of energy, created by the physical motion of a molecular gear. ATP is used in every kind of cell, where it‚Äôs converted into kinetic, chemical, or electrical energy.\n* Metabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n* The Warburg effect describes the peculiar fact that cancer cells tend to behave as if they‚Äôre in a metabolic emergency. When normal cells are short on oxygen, the mitochondrial turbines slow; anaerobic glycolysis, or fermentation, takes over. What‚Äôs strange is that cancer cells do this even when oxygen is abundant. The Warburg effect is considered almost universal across cancers; one relatively common sign of a tumor‚Äôs presence is a buildup of lactate, caused by the cancer cells fermenting. It‚Äôs unclear whether this fermentation is a cause or consequence of the disease. Do cancer cells ferment because they are growing out of control‚Äîor is fermentation driving the growth?\n* He argues that it might explain the outsized correlation between cancer and aging.\n* A popular hypothesis holds that the root cause of this mounting risk is the accumulation of genetic mutations.\n* rate of accumulation isn‚Äôt nearly fast enough to explain the extraordinary trajectory that cancer risk takes over a lifetime.\n* As you age, your mitochondria accumulate wear and tear. Often, the cause is inflammation‚Äîwhether from disease, injury, or periods of stress. Inflammation itself becomes chronic with age, for reasons that are still not entirely understood.\n* Meanwhile, a process known as mitophagy, in which old mitochondria are eaten by the body so that new ones can grow in their place, slows down. The result of all this is that our mitochondria get tired, and do a slightly worse job.\n* The conditions grow ripe for cancer: mitochondrial waste products start to pile up, as at a broken assembly line; perhaps, if it gets bad enough, a cell might believe that the backup is due to a lack of oxygen.\n* In that mode, when glucose arrives, the priority becomes stripping it not for its high-energy electrons but for molecular building blocks. The cell reverts to one of its earliest programs, active during embryonic development, in which the prime directive is not to work but to grow.\n* The impression I got from ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù was that the Krebs cycle was the key not just to life and its origins but to aging, cancer, and death. More likely it is just a part of all those things.\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.317694339Z","tags":null},"/read-it-later/Kindness-Tech-Staffing-and-Resource-Allocation":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2022/11/01/kindness-and-staffing/](url)\n* Author: Rachel Stephens | @rstephensme\n* Publisher: redmonk.com\n* Published Date: 2022-11-01\n* Tags: #business, #engineering\n\n## Highlights\n* How do we reconcile claims of vast overstaffing with claims of vast resource scarcity?\n* Both things can be true: it‚Äôs not a clear over- or under-staffing problem.

Were you intimated or excited? Eager or annoyed? Why?\nWhat was the first thing you did? Not the first thing the team did, but what did you do once you learned about the project? Did you schedule meetings with stakeholders, look through past research, write down everything you knew about the work to come, or something else?\nWhat was the first (or second) challenge you encountered? How did you feel? What did you do to work through the challenge with others?\nHow did the project typically progress? Did you need to rally the team together regularly, were regular meetings booked by a product manager for you, or did you set up consistent design critiques for the team to give you feedback? Did you do research, and if so, who scheduled it? How did all of that work feel for you?\nWere there any notable challenges you faced during the project? Call these out! Was there a disagreement between you and someone else? Was there a time you dropped something or failed to meet expectations? How did you recover from those things?\nWhere did the project end up?

This last idea so invisibly defines the medium that it‚Äôs hard not to take for granted, which is a shame because, as we‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs quite mistaken.\n* I‚Äôll feel I can sketch the basic claims, paint the surface; but when someone asks a basic probing question, the edifice instantly collapses. Sometimes it‚Äôs a memory issue: I simply can‚Äôt recall the relevant details. But just as often, as I grasp about, I‚Äôll realize I had never really understood the idea in question, though I‚Äôd certainly thought I understood when I read the book.\n* how much knowledge was absorbed? How many people absorbed most of the knowledge the author intended to convey? Or even just what they intended to acquire?\n* books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don‚Äôt realize it.\n* Why lectures don‚Äôt work\n* It‚Äôs easy to attend a lecture and feel that you understand, only to discover over that night‚Äôs problem set that you understood very little.\n* Books don‚Äôt work for the same reason that lectures don‚Äôt work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a result, both mediums accidentally (and mostly invisibly) evolved around a theory that‚Äôs plainly false.\n* You‚Äôve probably discovered that certain strategies help you absorb new ideas: solving interesting problems, writing chapter summaries, doing creative projects, etc.\n* There‚Äôs a reason they work (when they do): they‚Äôre leveraging some underlying truth about your cognition‚Äîabout the way you think and learn.\n* If we collect enough of these underlying ‚Äútruths,‚Äù some shared themes might emerge, suggesting a more coherent theory of how learning happens. We‚Äôll call such theories cognitive models.\n* In learning sciences, we call this model ‚Äútransmissionism.‚Äù It‚Äôs the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another.\n* The idea is so thoroughly discredited that ‚Äútransmissionism‚Äù is only used pejoratively, in reference to naive historical teaching practices.\n* understanding actually comes after the lecture, when attendees solve problem sets, write essays, etc. The lecture provides the raw information for those later activities.\n* so wouldn‚Äôt we want to interleave the problem-solving sessions with the lecture?\n* to understand something, you must actively engage with it.\n* If we really wanted to adopt the better model, we‚Äôd ditch the lectures, and indeed, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening in US K‚Äì12 education.\n* Readers can‚Äôt just read the words. They have to really think about them. Maybe take some notes. Discuss with others. Write an essay in response. Like a lecture, a book is a warmup for the thinking that happens later. Great: that‚Äôs a better model! Let‚Äôs look at\n* some people do absorb knowledge from books. Indeed, those are the people who really do think about what they‚Äôre reading.\n* If they take some notes, they‚Äôre not simply transcribing the author‚Äôs words: they‚Äôre summarizing, synthesizing, analyzing.\n* Readers must understand their own cognition.\n* These skills fall into a bucket which learning science calls ‚Äúmetacognition.‚Äù\n* great authors earnestly want readers to think carefully about their words. These authors form sophisticated pictures of their readers‚Äô evolving conceptions. They anticipate confusions readers might have, then shape their prose to acknowledge and mitigate those issues. They make constant choices about depth and detail using these models. They suggest what background knowledge might be needed for certain passages and where to go to get it. By shouldering some of readers‚Äô self-monitoring and regulation, these authors‚Äô efforts can indeed lighten the metacognitive burden. But metacognition is an inherently dynamic process, evolving continuously as readers‚Äô own conceptions evolve.\n* The reader must plan and steer their own feedback loops.\n* In fact, this kind of meta-processing of material‚Äîdesigning one‚Äôs own questions and generating one‚Äôs own feedback‚Äîare sometimes effective cognitive strategies. But as far as learning science understands it, they‚Äôre only effective for people who are already proficient with both the object-level concepts and also the relevant metacognitive skills.\n* textbooks usually are built around explicit cognitive models.\n* For instance, they often alternate between explanations which introduce concepts, and exercises which push students to think about those concepts in specific ways.\n* It‚Äôs striking that academic courses are often structured around textbooks, but lots of people spend the extra time and money to enroll in those courses‚Äîrather than just studying the textbooks independently.\n* by shouldering some of the metacognition, courses preserve more of students‚Äô attention for the material itself.\n* class discussions support social learning:\n* Courses can provide a personal relationship with a disciplinary expert,\n* courses offer a helpful accountability structure,\n* Courses also offer emotional salience,\n* I propose: we don‚Äôt necessarily have to make books work. We can make new forms instead.\n* part of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs necessary to understand‚Äù something is that most of its prerequisites must be not just familiar but fluent, encoded in long-term memory.\n* To help people encode more into long-term memory, we can draw on another powerful idea from cognitive science: spaced repetition. By re-testing yourself on material you‚Äôve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memoryFor\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T04:14:22.317694339Z","tags":null},"/zotero/munteanuModelingDrainCurrent2002":{"title":"","content":"\n# Annotations  \n(11/8/2022, 11:16:59 AM)\n\n[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1198\u0026annotation=V5TVLHIK)‚ÄúAbstract‚ÄîThis work reports on a new general modeling of recombination-based mechanisms related to electrically floating-body partially-depleted (PD) SOI MOSFETs.

The minority carriers needed in the inversion channel are rapidly supplied by the heavy doped source/drain regions. The positive pulse on the front gate leads to the depletion region extension, but in the case of a PD SOI film, the majority carriers expelled from this region cannot be removed instantaneously and are stored in the neutral body. This induces a temporary increase in the body potential, , which lowers the threshold voltage and results in excess drain current (Fig. 1). Equilibrium is reached through carrier recombination for removing the excess majority carriers.‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1198](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) This describes the physical reasons why drain current overshoots and how recombination effects bring it back to steady state\n\n [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1199\u0026annotation=ZRNFEIB7)  \n([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1199](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) Figure shows show the depletion region widens when a positive pulse is applied at the gate.
