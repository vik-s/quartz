There are as many reasons to fear as there are grains of sand on a beach.\n* there‚Äôs a simple trick to get over the initial hump: keep doing the thing until you feel numb.\n* In the case of Commonplace‚Äôs newsletter, it became ‚Äòanother thing I write on Tuesdays‚Äô. Ditto for blog writing, and podcasting, and public speaking.\n* The corollary to this idea is that you can only get good at something if you‚Äôre past the numb stage.\n* Or, to put this differently: focus on getting numb first. Then focus on getting good.\n* don‚Äôt seek feedback. If people offer you advice, shut it out. It‚Äôs not that feedback is bad, or that advice is terrible, it‚Äôs that none of it is useful until you‚Äôre numb.\n* whenever a friend asks me for advice on blogging, I tell them to just publish a post a week. I try not to give them advice about blog topics or writing techniques,\n* when you‚Äôre getting your kid started in sports, do what is necessary to get them numb before you focus on improving their technique.\n* When managing a content marketing team, get your podcast host to produce episodes at a weekly cadence before iterating for marketing impact.\n* if aforementioned new podcast host/producer is willing to share her work on her personal social media accounts, then she‚Äôs likely numb enough or proud enough of her work to be able to iterate effectively. It's only then that I can switch to more aggressive feedback. But not before.\n* Radio producer Ira Glass has a famous quote where he says:\n* All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.‚Äù\n* Get numb, then get good.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/Matter/How-Food-Powers-Your-Body":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories](url)\n* Author: James Somers\n* Publisher: The New Yorker\n* Published Date: 2022-10-25\n* Tags: \n\n## Highlights\n* Szent-Gy√∂rgyi is often credited with saying that life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest;\n* Glucose is like a chemical shipping container. It is an ideal electron transporter, in part because it is high-capacity, conveniently shaped, and easily opened up. It‚Äôs also unusually soluble, which means that it travels well through the bloodstream.\n* Our brains, whose parts have especially unpredictable energy requirements‚Äîas neurons fire, they create spikes in demand‚Äîdepend almost exclusively on glucose for energy.\n* When glucose reaches our cells, it is‚Äîunlike a shipping container‚Äîdismantled systematically. A series of reactions strips its highest-energy electrons and uses them to form a small ‚Äúcarrier molecule‚Äù known as an NADH. If glucose is like a shipping container, then NADHs are like delivery trucks. The process of loading the electrons into the trucks is called glycolysis.\n* When glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen, it is known as fermentation. If your muscles are pushed to their limit and there‚Äôs not enough oxygen in your bloodstream, your cells ferment glucose as a stopgap measure for energy production.\n* Oxygen is so hungry for electrons‚Äîits outer shell needs only two more to get a complete set‚Äîthat in effect it pulls them all the way through the Krebs cycle, which is the real powerhouse of our metabolism.\n* energy-rich electrons are peeled off and loaded up onto yet more NADHs‚Äîfar more than in glycolysis alone.\n* mitochondria‚Äîstructures believed to have descended from a free-floating bacterium that was ingested by one of our ancestors long ago and co√∂pted.\n* A mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which create a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane like rabbits poking their heads through a hedge. These proteins capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n* At the moment that the protein pulls each electron inward, it also disgorges the proton, pushing it from the internal chamber to the external one. This extrusion happens everywhere across the membrane. The result is that many positively charged protons build up outside, separated by a wall from the negatively charged electrons held inside. An electrical field comes into being. Quite literally, each mitochondrion becomes a battery, waiting to discharge.\n* The electrical field generated by the process, he explains, has a strength of around thirty million volts per metre‚Äî‚Äúequivalent to a bolt of lightning across every square nanometre of membrane.‚Äù\n* Pulled by the electrical current, they desperately want to get back to the inside of the mitochondrion, where the electrons are. Their only way back, however, is to squeeze through tiny mushroom-shaped conduits that litter the membrane. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are actually little turbines. Seen in minute detail through electron microscopes, they resemble waterwheels; the protons turn them as they pass.\n* each turn of the wheel assembles a molecule of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP‚Äîthe energy currency of our cells.\n* By dint of its structure, ATP is extremely willing to give up its energy, but it is prevented from doing so by a few precisely controllable molecular speed bumps‚Äîlike\n* each molecule of ATP is endowed with a standard amount of energy, created by the physical motion of a molecular gear. ATP is used in every kind of cell, where it‚Äôs converted into kinetic, chemical, or electrical energy.\n* Metabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n* The Warburg effect describes the peculiar fact that cancer cells tend to behave as if they‚Äôre in a metabolic emergency. When normal cells are short on oxygen, the mitochondrial turbines slow; anaerobic glycolysis, or fermentation, takes over. What‚Äôs strange is that cancer cells do this even when oxygen is abundant. The Warburg effect is considered almost universal across cancers; one relatively common sign of a tumor‚Äôs presence is a buildup of lactate, caused by the cancer cells fermenting. It‚Äôs unclear whether this fermentation is a cause or consequence of the disease. Do cancer cells ferment because they are growing out of control‚Äîor is fermentation driving the growth?\n* He argues that it might explain the outsized correlation between cancer and aging.\n* A popular hypothesis holds that the root cause of this mounting risk is the accumulation of genetic mutations.\n* rate of accumulation isn‚Äôt nearly fast enough to explain the extraordinary trajectory that cancer risk takes over a lifetime.\n* As you age, your mitochondria accumulate wear and tear. Often, the cause is inflammation‚Äîwhether from disease, injury, or periods of stress. Inflammation itself becomes chronic with age, for reasons that are still not entirely understood.\n* Meanwhile, a process known as mitophagy, in which old mitochondria are eaten by the body so that new ones can grow in their place, slows down. The result of all this is that our mitochondria get tired, and do a slightly worse job.\n* The conditions grow ripe for cancer: mitochondrial waste products start to pile up, as at a broken assembly line; perhaps, if it gets bad enough, a cell might believe that the backup is due to a lack of oxygen.\n* In that mode, when glucose arrives, the priority becomes stripping it not for its high-energy electrons but for molecular building blocks. The cell reverts to one of its earliest programs, active during embryonic development, in which the prime directive is not to work but to grow.\n* The impression I got from ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù was that the Krebs cycle was the key not just to life and its origins but to aging, cancer, and death. More likely it is just a part of all those things.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/Matter/Kindness-Tech-Staffing-and-Resource-Allocation":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2022/11/01/kindness-and-staffing/](url)\n* Author: Rachel Stephens | @rstephensme\n* Publisher: redmonk.com\n* Published Date: 2022-11-01\n* Tags: #business, #engineering\n\n## Highlights\n* How do we reconcile claims of vast overstaffing with claims of vast resource scarcity?\n* Both things can be true: it‚Äôs not a clear over- or under-staffing problem. It‚Äôs a problem of proportionality.\n* Friedman‚Äôs tweet referencing that ‚Äúwhen the money is flowing freely it‚Äôs easier to hire more people than deal with low performers‚Äù rings true.\n* challenges of the engineer-to-manager career path; managing people is a very different skill set than being an individual contributor, and not all engineers are set up with the skills they need to succeed as managers and have those tough conversations.\n* if you‚Äôre looking at a holistic allocation of resources then allocation of capital definitely needs to be considered in conjunction with allocation of people.

This last idea so invisibly defines the medium that it‚Äôs hard not to take for granted, which is a shame because, as we‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs quite mistaken.\n* I‚Äôll feel I can sketch the basic claims, paint the surface; but when someone asks a basic probing question, the edifice instantly collapses. Sometimes it‚Äôs a memory issue: I simply can‚Äôt recall the relevant details. But just as often, as I grasp about, I‚Äôll realize I had never really understood the idea in question, though I‚Äôd certainly thought I understood when I read the book.\n* how much knowledge was absorbed? How many people absorbed most of the knowledge the author intended to convey? Or even just what they intended to acquire?\n* books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don‚Äôt realize it.\n* Why lectures don‚Äôt work\n* It‚Äôs easy to attend a lecture and feel that you understand, only to discover over that night‚Äôs problem set that you understood very little.\n* Books don‚Äôt work for the same reason that lectures don‚Äôt work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a result, both mediums accidentally (and mostly invisibly) evolved around a theory that‚Äôs plainly false.\n* You‚Äôve probably discovered that certain strategies help you absorb new ideas: solving interesting problems, writing chapter summaries, doing creative projects, etc.\n* There‚Äôs a reason they work (when they do): they‚Äôre leveraging some underlying truth about your cognition‚Äîabout the way you think and learn.\n* If we collect enough of these underlying ‚Äútruths,‚Äù some shared themes might emerge, suggesting a more coherent theory of how learning happens. We‚Äôll call such theories cognitive models.\n* In learning sciences, we call this model ‚Äútransmissionism.‚Äù It‚Äôs the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another.\n* The idea is so thoroughly discredited that ‚Äútransmissionism‚Äù is only used pejoratively, in reference to naive historical teaching practices.\n* understanding actually comes after the lecture, when attendees solve problem sets, write essays, etc. The lecture provides the raw information for those later activities.\n* so wouldn‚Äôt we want to interleave the problem-solving sessions with the lecture?\n* to understand something, you must actively engage with it.\n* If we really wanted to adopt the better model, we‚Äôd ditch the lectures, and indeed, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening in US K‚Äì12 education.\n* Readers can‚Äôt just read the words. They have to really think about them. Maybe take some notes. Discuss with others. Write an essay in response. Like a lecture, a book is a warmup for the thinking that happens later. Great: that‚Äôs a better model! Let‚Äôs look at\n* some people do absorb knowledge from books. Indeed, those are the people who really do think about what they‚Äôre reading.\n* If they take some notes, they‚Äôre not simply transcribing the author‚Äôs words: they‚Äôre summarizing, synthesizing, analyzing.\n* Readers must understand their own cognition.\n* These skills fall into a bucket which learning science calls ‚Äúmetacognition.‚Äù\n* great authors earnestly want readers to think carefully about their words. These authors form sophisticated pictures of their readers‚Äô evolving conceptions. They anticipate confusions readers might have, then shape their prose to acknowledge and mitigate those issues. They make constant choices about depth and detail using these models. They suggest what background knowledge might be needed for certain passages and where to go to get it. By shouldering some of readers‚Äô self-monitoring and regulation, these authors‚Äô efforts can indeed lighten the metacognitive burden. But metacognition is an inherently dynamic process, evolving continuously as readers‚Äô own conceptions evolve.\n* The reader must plan and steer their own feedback loops.\n* In fact, this kind of meta-processing of material‚Äîdesigning one‚Äôs own questions and generating one‚Äôs own feedback‚Äîare sometimes effective cognitive strategies. But as far as learning science understands it, they‚Äôre only effective for people who are already proficient with both the object-level concepts and also the relevant metacognitive skills.\n* textbooks usually are built around explicit cognitive models.\n* For instance, they often alternate between explanations which introduce concepts, and exercises which push students to think about those concepts in specific ways.\n* It‚Äôs striking that academic courses are often structured around textbooks, but lots of people spend the extra time and money to enroll in those courses‚Äîrather than just studying the textbooks independently.\n* by shouldering some of the metacognition, courses preserve more of students‚Äô attention for the material itself.\n* class discussions support social learning:\n* Courses can provide a personal relationship with a disciplinary expert,\n* courses offer a helpful accountability structure,\n* Courses also offer emotional salience,\n* I propose: we don‚Äôt necessarily have to make books work. We can make new forms instead.\n* part of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs necessary to understand‚Äù something is that most of its prerequisites must be not just familiar but fluent, encoded in long-term memory.\n* To help people encode more into long-term memory, we can draw on another powerful idea from cognitive science: spaced repetition. By re-testing yourself on material you‚Äôve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memoryFor\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/blog/2022-in-Review":{"title":"2022 in Review","content":"\nInspired by [this](https://blog.ktz.me/2022-in-review/), I figured I'll make my own list of cool stuff I did in 2022.\n\n- AirBnb in a farm in Ranchita, CA\n\t- Feeding Kringle the goat was star attraction for the kids\n\t- Beautiful barn to relax in the quiet evenings\n- Borrego Springs Camp\n\t- 70+ mph winds caused tents to fly into the desert\n\t- Abandoned trip, retured home\n- Ventura Ranch KOA\n\t- Kids enjoyed the giant bouncy pillow\n\t- Stayed in a cabin instead of tent\n\t- Gets pretty crowded\n- Palm Springs KOA\n\t- 70+ mph winds but tied tents to car frame\n\t- Tent *only* collapsed once\n\t- Overcrowded pool, gravel tent sites\n- Temecula KOA\n\t- July 4th trip.

Instead of creating annual resolutions, which are oft bound to fail due to their rigid nature, a yearly theme is a broad framework that is intended to guide my actions towards my goals.\n\n## Looking back at 2022 themes\n\nIn 2022, I chose two themes to guide me: **Health** and **Music**. I talk about this in my [podcast](https://www.halflife.show/7) in greater depth. I want to reflect on how that worked out for a minute.\n\nIn terms of health, I started resistance training three times a week and that has helped drop my body fat percentange by about 3%. I'm not going to extol the benefits of having lean muscle mass in this article, but it is key to proper hormone regulation and metabolic health. \n\nTo build muscle, I have been targeting about 1g of protein intake per pound of body weight, per day. It has been hard to keep up, unless I include a significant amount of meat in my diet, which I cannot always do for various reasons. I've prioritized sleep over everything else in the evenings, targeting 7+ hours of consistent shut-eye everyday. These health themed lifestyle changes have greatly improved by mood, energy and cognition throughout the day.\n\nMusic has been much harder for me to keep up with consistently. I was not able to adhere to a strict practice schedule, but I did become more concious about improving my technique when I did actually play guitar, instead of noodling away my time. I took a month's worth of lessons with [Straten Marshall](https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall/), and he pointed out that my alternate picking suffered because my hands were not synchronized. It seems obvious in hindsight, but working on that specifically has helped a lot. My alternate picking has gotten a lot cleaner and faster as a result. I have included playing scales and modes in my practice routine. These are boring, but necessary.\n\nPlaying music with others has been a challege, due to time contraints of everybody involved. I have considered [[permanent/using zettelkasten for music composition|an alternate approach]] to music composition based on a [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician|blog article]] I read, but I'll have to see how that works out in practice. I have joined a community rock band to play music with other people, but that has not proved to be challenging or instructive thus far.\n\n## Now, not later\n\nThis is my yearly theme for 2023. As of this writing, I'm about halfway reading [[literature/B-Burkeman-2021|4000 weeks by Oliver Burkeman]], and while I disagree with a lot of his views, I do accept that ==time is finite==. We have about 4000 weeks to live. Too often, I end up delaying things to another time, or working towards a better future without enjoying the now. This is the now. This is it. I'm here. And I've already spent about 2000 weeks of my life.\n\nTo apply this theme, I'm going to have to keep in mind a few key concepts:\n\n1. I have to restrict the number of things I actually pursue. For example, I cannot learn a new programming language, and contribute to open-source projects. Why? Because I am already running a podcast, have a family with young kids, play music, and like to read and write, while having a full time job. This leaves few hours to much else. It's time to accept that.\n2. I have to be fully present in the now and learn to quickly slip into a flow state at whatever I am doing, whether it be office work, music, playing with kids or doing the dishes. No multi-tasking. Minimal distraction.\n3. No more productivity hacks. No hourly planning, to-do lists, pomodoro timers, or overly complex workflows. Daily highlights are okay to keep a focus on what needs to get done. Go through the day giving each task the attention it deserves - no more, no less, and see where things land. Pick up what falls to the wayside at another time.\n4. Apply the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) whenever possible. Be aware that the last 20% of any task takes 80% of the time (that I don't already have.) Be happy with the 80%, while knowing that perfection is admirable but costly.\n5. This one is cheesy, but true. Live everyday like it is your last. This might be the last time I ever did something. Pick up my child, visit Las Vegas, or go surfing. Enjoy and savor every moment because I might never get it again.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIt is necessary to slow down the conveyor belt of tasks that appear in life, and my yearly theme is designed to do that. This does not mean I abandon my previous years' themes entirely when the new one arrives. I will still work on my health and music. I view it as a continuous evolution of myself. I absorb each years theme till it becomes a part of me. This is the only way we can all become better versions of ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allblog":{"title":"All Blog Posts","content":"\n2022-12-19: [[blog/Yearly Themes 2023|Yearly Themes 2023]]\n2022-12-31: [[blog/2022 in Review|2022 in Review]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/blog/_allpodcast":{"title":"All Podcast Notes","content":"\n[[literature/P-Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health|Huberman Lab Podcast: Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.961321855Z","tags":null},"/blog/_now":{"title":"Now","content":"\nüì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices\n\nüéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [Half Life Show](https://www.halflife.show)\n\n‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my [tech blog](https://rfic.io)\n\n## Health\n\nOver the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based foods when possible. Stretching is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.\n\n## Music\n\nI play in the community rock band at [Villa Musica](https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock). I was a former lead guitarist for [FUSED](https://www.reverbnation.com/fused). I was a founding member of [Black Earth](https://blackearth.in).

Regions like the brain have unusual and rather erratic energy needs. The body exclusively relies on glucose for energy.\n\n[[permanent/Glucose is the fundamental means of transporting energy to various parts of the body]] because it is unusally insoluable and can travel well through the blood stream. Think about it as an ideal electron shipping container.\n\n### What is Glycolysis?\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis is the breaking down of a glucose molecule]]\n\nWhen glucose reaches the destination cell, the highest energy electrons are stripped and used to construct a carrier module known as NADH  (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide + Hydrogen, or coenzyme 1), in a process called glycolysis. It is the breaking down of glucose (glyco = glucose, lysis = break down).\n\n[[permanent/Glycolysis in the absence of oxygen]]\nWhen glycolysis happens in the absense of oxygen, it is known as fermentation and it produces lactate. This is a stop gap measure for energy production when it is really needed quickly, like during exercise when muscles are pushed to their limit.\n\n### What is Krebs Cycle?\n\n\n### What is mitochondria and how do they work in the body?\n\n[[permanent/Mitochondria and their structure]]\nThey are structures believed to have descended from free-floating bacterium that our ancestors injected a long time ago. They do not share the same DNA make-up as humans, but instead they have their own DNA, and co-exist with humans to enable life as we know it.\n\nA mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which creates a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane to capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.\n\n[[permanent/Mechanism of generation of ATP by mitochondria]]\nWhen an electron is pulled into its internal chamber of the mitochondrion, a proton is expelled to the outer chamber. An electric field is built up between the inner and outer chamber. Each mitochondrion is like an electric battery waiting to discharge. The electric field strength is about 30 million V/m. Its like lightning in a bottle.\n\nThe proton is subject to an electric field and wants to get back into the inner chamber where the electric fields are. The only way through is to pass through small conduits shaped like mushrooms. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are like little turbines and the protons turn them as the pass through it. Each turn of the turbine assembles a molecule of Adenosine TriPhosphate, or ATP, which is the fundamental energy currency of the body. It is converted into kinetic, chemical or electrical energy by the body.\n\n\u003eMetabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.\n\n\\- James Somers\n\nAs you age, inflammation from a variety of causes such as disease, injury, diet, and stress causes mitochondrial wear and tear. Even just aging seems to cause mitochondria to wear, and that is not yet entirely understood. Old mitochondria are eaten by the body by a process called [[Mitophagy]], and new ones take its place. Aging slows down the replacement rate of mitochondria eventually.\n\n### The Warburg effect\n\n[[permanent/The Warburg Effect is a phenomenon where cancerous cells behave as if they are in a metabolic emergency]], like  during heavy exercise, where there is a shortage of oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis takes over in the cancer cells even when there is plenty of oxygen, and the cells start to ferment building up lactate. This happens universally among all cancers, and the presense of lactate is a common sign of a tumor's presence.\n\n### Link between mitochondrial, aging and cancer\n\nDue to mitochondrial wear and tear, waste products from the mitochondria start to pile up, and the body believes that this is due to a lack of oxygen. It then begins anerobic glycolysis and the cells start to ferment with the buildup of lactate. When glucose arrives, the cell does not strip away high frequency electrons as usual, but instead starts up the process for building more cells, which is one of its earliest directives during embryonic development. As a result, cancerous cells grow in the presence of fermenting cells and lactate, and is a possible explanation of the Warburg effect.\n\n----\n# References\n\n- [[How Food Powers Your Body]]\n- https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-food-powers-your-body-metabolism-calories","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/A-Turning-music-into-a-chore-is-how-I-became-a-musician":{"title":"Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThe author of this article explains that by treating music making like a routine job that you do everyday, and putting in the time day after day without worrying about how good the output is, you can become really productive and consistent in making music, and produce high quality work.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Put in sheer time to get better at your craft, watch videos, learn how things are done.\n- Make music everyday, or on a repeatable set pattern. It's not something that depends on whether you feel like it or not.\n- Create a list of \"chores\" that is required to finish a piece of music. Do it everyday. Things to think about:\n\t- Steps to take a song from nothing to finish\n\t- Methods of music storage and retrieval for composition\n\t- Techniques to arrange the music into sections, how will you deal with bpm issues?\n\t- How will you control performance quality? Will you replay the tracks?\n\t- How will you remember how to play it? Will you figure it out again?\n\t- What is the plan for lyric writing (again something to practice everyday)? And how will you sing it? Pick a style that suits your voice- Like OSI.\n\t- What about the production phase, Mixing and Mastering?\n\t- Can you use AI-art (Stable diffusion) to generate album covers?\n\t- What is your method of distribution?\n- Never judge a piece of music when you just created it. File it away, you might love it later.\n- Make music boring. Get numb before you get good.\n\nThis follows the same principle that I've heard [[Misha Mansoor]] from [[Periphery]] talk about. He made tons of songs under the name of [[Bulb]]. He mentions too that he kept at it, till he got better at composing music. For example, he released his 110-song album from his pre-Periphery days in various parts. https://blabbermouth.net/news/peripherys-misha-mansoor-to-release-10-albums-of-bulb-material/\n\n# References\n\nhttps://the.scapegoat.dev/turning-music-into-a-chore-is-what-made-me-an-artist","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Ahrens-2017":{"title":"How to Take Smart Notes","content":"\n![How to take smart notes](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61ea8612f1b4331a57b5f9d1/1652195260055-D0V8QNUADQJ8YPJTDQR7/TSN-English-small.jpg?format=300w)\n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n[[permanent/Good workflow design]]\n\nA good workflow design should:\n- be simple to use\n- enable one to use the mind exclusively for thinking, learning, insight, and generation of ideas\n- offload all other aspects of information storage and memory retrieval to an external system\n- allow to jump in and out of lines of thought\n- make work productive and fun\n\n[[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]]\n\nPlanning imposes a rigid and inflexible structure that cannot adapt as we learn new insights while working. To stick to the \"plan\", we need to have the willpower to overcome the resistance to follow the inflexible plan. Willpower is a quickly depleted resource, and it is best not to have to use it at all. By adopting zettelkasten, you can stay flexible, turn your attention to new insights and keep your interest, motivation and work aligned. This makes work effortless.\n\n[[fleeting/Dunning-Kruger Effect]]\n\n### Definition\nPeople with the least amount of knowledge tend to overestimate their competence level, and vice versa. They are faced with a [[dual burden]]: ignorance, and ignorance of their ignorance.\n\n### How does this affect us?\n- You lose opportunities to learn from people better than you\n- You fail to share your experise with others thinking you are not good enough aka, [[imposter syndrome]]\n- You feel disappointed when others do not recognize your talents, that you think you are excellent at\n- You fail to identify your true talents, results in poor life and career choices\n- Loudest voice in the room seems more effective than the experts opinion\n\n### How can we avoid this?\n- Be aware of the cognitive biases imposed by the Dunning Kruger syndrome and know that what you perceive may not be true\n- Compare yourself to others to get a more informed evaulation about your true strengths and weaknesses\n- Be open to criticism and feedback from others\n\n[[permanent/Value of an idea depends on its context]]\n\n## Chapter 2: Everything you need to do\n\n[[permanent/The importance of writing for learning, understanding, thinking and retention]]\n[[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]\n\n## Chapter 3: Everything you need to have\n\n\u003e[!Quote]The only thing necessary is to have an undistracted brain to think with, and a collection of notes which is the external scaffold for information storage\n\nOnly four tools are necessary:\n- Something to write stuff down on\n\t- A pen and pocket notebook is the best and simplest. You will write down thoughts that will be thrown away soon anyway after processing. Just capture your ideas.\n- Reference management system\n\t- Collect references and also notes you take during reading. Zotero is a highly recommended program with sufficient plugins\n- Slip-Box (Zettelkasten)\n\t- Use a digital note taking system to take your notes in. Obsidian seems to be the go-to here.\n- Text Editor\n\t- Zotero integration into the text editor is helpful. Obsidian already has that.\n\n## Chapter 4: Few things to keep in mind\n\n\u003e A tool is only as good as your ability to work with them.\n\\- Sonke Ahrens\n\nIt is important to understand what the slip-box system is, and how to use it, but also you should know *why* it works, so that you can tweak the tool to your needs.\n\n\n# Four underlying principles\n\n## Chapter 5: Writing is the only thing that matters\n\n\u003e An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.\n\nWriting is the only thing that counts in learning, research or studying. It *is* learning, research or study. Often in schools, writing is described as a separate activity done at the end of the research program. The typical sequence of learning/research is:  \"Brainstorm\" a research idea, read papers about it, do the necessary research, come to conclusions, and write a paper. But this is not true; writing helps during every stage of the research evolution.\n\n#### What are the advantages of writing while learning?\n- You will feel more engaged\n- You will learn to differentiate good ideas from one that only sound good\n- Your reading will be more engaged because you have to connect the note to ideas in your note collection by writing them in your own words\n- Much more likely to remember\n- You will do everything more deliberately\n\n## Chapter 6: Simplicity  is paramount\n\nThe old way of note taking is really what I been doing all my life- underline something in a book, write something in a margin, or write my thoughts on a sheet of paper to file away by topic. But this has never really worked. I forget where I put the note, how to get it back, and sometimes that I even wrote the note. There is no use in taking such notes in the first place. \n\nTake proper notes instead. So what is needed from this new system?\n\nA low threshold for taking notes, a process of elaborating your own thoughts on them in a day or two, and a way of storing such thoughts and interlinking them.\n\nOld system asks- Where do I store this note?\nNew system asks- In what context will I stumble on it again?\n\nOld system is a top down approach where you have to know where this \"belongs\" even before you developed insight. As your notes grow, it gets messier.\nNew system is a bottom up approach where your insights develop as the notes increases. It gets more orderly rather than messy.\n\nBut the slip box system can get messy too, if you add notes indiscriminately, without paying attention to their quality and the connections they make with your other notes. This is something to pay attention to.\n\nWhen it comes to taking notes, you must clearly distinguish between 3 kinds:\n1. Fleeting-  only to capture your notes, to be thrown away later.\n2. Permanent- well written notes in your own words that are never thrown away, but you will make connections to other such notes, and will eventually lead to insight. It has to be elabored on so that it will make sense on its own, without the context it was taken from.\n3. project- only needed when working on a project. Can be thrown away later. Examples of such notes are outlines, writing snippets, reminders, to-do lists, draft papers, etc.\n\n[[permanent/Common pitfalls in note taking methods]]:\n1. You treat every thought as though it were a permanent note. This dilutes the quality of actual good notes, and creates a mess.\n2. You take project specific notes. You decide what you want to write about, then work on collecting all the relevant info, and create notes for the project. This means that you have to start the process over for every project. Any other idea that is not relevant to the project will end up being discarded. This is a great loss to development of insight because at that moment you will not know what is important and what is not, and therefore discard valuable ideas.\n3. You treat every note as a fleeting note. You write ideas down on a scratch paper, and these pile up when you dont process them in any way, and soon you will forget their context and significance.\n\n## Chapter 7: Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch\n\nEvery academic writing book tells you that you should first decide what the topic you are going to work on is going to be, then collect and read all the relevant material, make notes (usually ends up as highlights and in the margins), and then write a report. \n\nThere are several downsides to this approach:\n1. You have picked the topic without knowing much about it at all\n\t1. No insight has been developed yet\n\t2. You might realize that this topic does not interest you. This results in being demotivated to work\n2. You face a blank screen or a blank paper when you are about to write\n3. You resort to *brainstorming* which is a very unreliable way to retrieve information from our brains that usually cannot store detailed information for very long\n\nThe main point here is that your writing starts long before you actually need to produce a report. You learn by writing, while you read a particular topic. You are always driven and motivated because you are following your interests and insight to see where it takes you, instead of working towards an ill-informed topic right from the start. When it is time to produce written material, it is simply a matter of arranging already written notes and filling in the gaps. \n\n## Chapter 8: Let the work carry you forward\n\nHaving ways of consistently and frequently receiving feedback on your work will provide a positive experience that will enable you to quickly get better at what you are learning. This quickly creates a positive spiral where we start to enjoy the work we do, work more and then get even better at the subject, and further enjoy our work! This way, the work carries you forward. This is no involvement of willpower or planning here. This related to [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]]. This concept should somehow apply to [[Music]] and instrument playing too. The better you get, the better you sound, and therefore more likely to play longer, ensuring a positive spiral.\n\nThe slip-box note taking system gives you the constant feedback you need to stay motivated by providing us with contradictions, connections and inconsistencies in relation to other notes in the slip box. This enables us to pursue further lines of thought to resolve these differences we see in the slip box. In addition, expressing writing in your own words really gives you feedback on whether you have fully understood the concept you are addressing. This will cement your learning much more reliably and enable you to get better even quicker.\n\n- [ ] Write about the growth Mindset\n\n\n# Six Steps to successful writing\n\n## Chapter 9: Separate and Interlocking tasks\n\n1. Each task should get undivided attention. No multitasking.\n2. Each writing task needs a different kind of attention (proof, critic, author, outlining). Everything requires a different perspective to get the job done. \n3. During reading, every kind of text needs a different kind of attention too.\n4. Do not follow prescribed or planning methods and strategies from other people to create your work; become an expert by spending time on it, making mistakes and developing experience that allows you to go by intuition.\n5. Break up the process of creation in smaller and more specific tasks and work on them to completion. Write down thoughts that arise along the way, and process them later. Our short term memory is limited.\n6. Have a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] that enables you to focus only on the creating aspect, and not on the workflow itself. You will be able to minimize [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work]], and switch tasks easily without losing thoughts. \n\nIt is interesting that a lot of these steps are what is described in [[literature/A-Turning music into a chore is how I became a musician]]\n\nAhrens goes into a quick tangent about creativity that is interesting. It has been found that the most creative minds in science or art have both kinds of attention: wide-open and playful, and narrow analytical frame. This *flexibility* is essential to creativity. I was just thinking how various kinds are attention are needed to compose a piece of music: think of the song structure is different from composing a solo.\n\n## Chapter 10: Read for Understanding\n\nAlways read with a pen in hand so that you can write down in your own words the meaning of the text you are reading. How detailed the literature notes are depends on the nature  of the text and how detailed it is. Sometimes you will need to write a lot of notes for a book, and sometimes you can simply write down a few sentences to summarize a book. The important thing is to write down permanent notes while finding ways in which the ideas from the book fit in your slipbox. You have to reflect on the book about what it tries to convey, what practices were used, what assumptions were made, etc. It is as much as what is *not* written that what *is* written. The read end-goal is to create permanent notes. Dont make taking literature notes a project in iteself.\n\nConfirmation bias is one of the biggest dangers in research where we seek out only what we agree with. Read with an open mind, and collect ideas indiscriminately in your slipbox whether you agree with them or not. You only purpose is to make connections to other permanent notes. This will help create new insight and avenues for thought, and will result in much better work that addresses pros and cons.\n\nPractice extracting the gist of the idea when you are reading. Express it in a concise and clear way, and be very selective. Thinking beyond the text and applying it in a different context is vital to clear understanding.\n\nThe process of creating notes tests your understanding of the text by explaining it to your future self. Re-reading a text only gives an illusion of understanding because of confirmation bias. Writing it down trying to teach your future self is the only way to understanding and learning. Test yourself.\n\nThe most successful method of learning is elaboration, which involves thinking, writing and connecting to other pieces of already known information. It may take time to do so, but without it reading a book is a waste of time because there is no learning for the long term.\n\n## Chapter 11: Take Smart Notes\n\nA reasonable measure of productivity in a day is the number of notes added to the slip box. \n\nIn 11.2, Ahrens gives an example of how he read a book, and then developed personal notes out of it. It is good for the reader to have a clear example of how this slip box system works. In my opinion, this should have been presented much earlier in the book instead of waiting for Chapter  11!\n\nThere are two steps to elaboration: \n1. Think deeply enough about what you are reading\n2. Think about the meaning in other contexts than the text\n\nMake sure your note can be found later, by including them in an index or making sure it can connect form an index.\nBuild a \"Latticework of Mental Models\"\n\n## Chapter 12: Develop Ideas\n\nDont worry about gaps in the notes as it relates to concepts. If it helps you think better, write down the gaps in the thought process as a note as well. Most gaps in the argument will only become clear when you take out notes from the slip box to create a draft\n\nDont link too many notes from an index, just one or two. The interlinks between notes are much more important because being surprised by connections between notes is important later on.\n\nIf you want to write an article from a bunch of notes, create a new note with links to them. This can be temporary and subject to change as the topic develops. If the topic deviates significantly from your initial conception of the article, you can even create another note different from the first one.\n\nWhen creating notes, think of what keywords you might assign to it. Just one or two that puts it in a context different from where you got the note from. This is not the same as creating tags (that is more for note sorting in Obsidian). Look for unlinked mentions in Obsidian for possible suggestions to where you can link to other contexts. \n\nIf a topic has accumulated a significant number of notes on a topic, you might need a note that forms an index with links to about 25 notes with short descriptions of each. You will know when you need such a note. This note can then be linked to from the main index.\n\nAdding ideas to slip box leads to refinements, contradictions and corrections to old ideas, and overcomes the feature-positive effect, where we give more importance to more recent information even if its not the most relevant. Slip box enables us to access long forgotten ideas.\n\n\u003e You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head\n\u003e \\-Charlie Munger\n\nA slip box is a space where ideas can mingle freely so that you can come up with new ones.\n\nThe key to creative problem solving is the abstraction of ideas into more general context. This is something that a [[permanent/Good workflow design]] should support.\n\nOur brain is wired to jump to conclusions on what we are reading. Only upon revisiting, rethinking and revising our notes on the text can we truly understand or interpret in a different way. This is being \"open-minded\" with ourselves, knowing that our own interpretation can change.\n\nCreativity can have its roots from simple ideas pieced together to form something complex. This reminds me of a multilevel perceptron in machine learning.\n\nRestriction and structure are an essential crucible in which creativity is forged.\n\n## Chapter 13: Share your insight\n\nWriting with a zettelkasten system is simple:\n1. Look at your notes and see where the keywords cluster. That determines your topic.\n2. Gather all relevent notes and piece together an outline\n3. Identify missing arguments and work on filling them\n4. Forget about the slip box and narrow focus on getting the writing done\n5. Work on mutiple writing projects concurrantly, switching between them as often as you like\n6. Never fear to cut text from your drafts, and re-write as many times as needed.\n\nBeing intimately famiiliar with the slip box system enables you to internalize the ideas in it through elaboration. Your mind becomes more open and receptive to new lines of thought, fostering creative work.\n\n\n## Chapter 14: Make it a habit\n\nMake it a habit to read with a pen and paper in hand.\n\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.

When he spotted Feynman‚Äôs notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such ‚Äúwonderful records of Feynman‚Äôs thinking.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù Feynman protested. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the historian said, ‚Äúthe work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not a record, not really. It‚Äôs working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.‚Äù\n‚Äù\n\n## Survivorship bias in airplane bullet holes\n‚Äúwe can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us. \n\nOne of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn‚Äôt make it back. The RAF fell for a common error in thinking called survivorship bias (Taleb 2005). The other planes didn‚Äôt make it back because they were hit where they should have had extra protection, like the fuel tank. The returning planes could only\nshow what was less relevant.‚Äù\n\n\n## Hemingway and rewriting drafts\n‚ÄúErnest Hemingway was once asked how often he rewrote his first draft. \nHis answer: ‚ÄúIt depends. I rewrote the ending of ‚ÄòA Farewell to Arms,‚Äô the last page of it, thirty-nine times before I was satisfied.‚Äù \n‚ÄúWas there some technical problem there? What was it that had stumped you?‚Äù the interviewer asked. \n‚ÄúGetting the words right,‚Äù Hemingway replied (Paris Review, 1956).‚Äù\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Burkeman-2021":{"title":"Four Thousand Weeks: Time management for mortals","content":"![4k-weeks](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/053ea9_019073577d0445b6b521687231c3166f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1420,h_1312,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/1621444132.png)\n## What is the book about?\n\nOur time on this earth is limited to four thousand weeks, but our commitments, goals and desires far outstretch what is achievable in this short span of time. This book is about facing our finitude and making choices to pick and choose activities that give us most happiness and satisfaction in our limited time. Reader should be aware that this book often dabbles in existential nihilism hinting that our life is so short that it is basically devoid of meaning. Instead, the takeaway really here is that time is our most valuable resource and we should treat it as such.\n\n## Who should read this book?\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed with the number of things piling up in your to-do list, fueled by your commitment to work, family and hobbies that you derive satisfaction, this book gives some perspectives on how we can pick and choose things that we will get most happiness from. If you have trouble saying no, this book will help you identify that making hard choices is required to make use of our finite time. I would assume that this book is directed at at-least 30 somethings who have reached a point in their career and family where the number of obligations is too much to meet. \n\n## Tools to embrace our finitude\n\n- Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity\n\t- Use dual to-do list approach:\n\t\t- A \"current\" one limited to 10 entries. Only by finishing tasks, can you make way for more.\n\t\t- An \"open\" one that you put all your tasks into, knowing full well that some of them may never be finished.\n\t- Another apporach is to use a fixed time approach to establish the boundaries of daily work.\n- Serialize\n\t- Only focus on a big project at a time and see it to completion before moving on to the next.\n- Decide in advance what to fail at\n\t- There are great benefits to strategic underachievement. You can identify beforehard what you intend to do poorly at, and that will make way for you to succeed in the important things. You can also take a cyclical approach to failing, where you decide that you will not do something or do it poorly for the next few months.\n- Make a Completed list\n\t- Instead of always looking to a to-do list, start a completed list and only list tasks you have completed on it. This will avoid the anxiety of seeing all the tasks yet to be finished and derive satisfaction from your successes.\n- Consolidate your caring\n\t- If you are donating time to charity, political causes or activism, make sure you limit yourself to a few tasks.\n- Embrace single purpose technology\n\t- Pen and paper is often effective for note taking\n\t- When not reading physical books, kindle has minimal distractions compared to iPads\n- Seek out novelty in the mundane\n\t- Enjoy what you are doing instead of seeking out new pleasures. Absorb the now, and you will fill out time a lot longer. Go on walks, play with a child, meditate. Draw attention to the present.\n- Become a better listener\n\t- Relationships will be strengthened if you pay more attention to the other person speaking. Ask questions and adopt a mentality of curiousity, and show that you genuinely care about others.\n- Become spontaneous\n\t- If you think of calling a friend, do it right away. If you want to donate money, dont put it off until too much later.\n- Practice doing nothing\n\t- Just doing nothing enables you to feel the sensations and time flowing around you. Be present in it and stop trying to constantly manipulate your present experience.\n\n## Chapter Notes\n### Introduction: In the long run, we're all dead\n\n* We have 4000 weeks to live. Thats very short in the grand scheme of things. This book is about facing that fact, and accepting that we will never get everything done\n* Productivity has become: how do we cram most number of tasks into as little time as possible\n* We all regret \"wasting\" time when we are either too busy (no time to do what I want) or when having too much time (what should i have really been doing with my time?), because we are aware that time is limited.\n* Contrast life to a conveyor belt:\n\t* Tasks keep coming and we are supposed to get it done\n\t* We use productivity tools and shave time off each task\n\t* This causes conveyor below to move faster -\u003e more tasks\n- John Maynard Keene predicted that we will have 15 hour work weeks soon. He was wrong. We work more than ever now\n- Busyness has become a symbol of prestige, which is strange because the goal of getting rich is to not work as hard.\n* We yearn to spend time in more meaningful ways:\n\t* desire to devote to larger cause\n\t* having day job to cover what you really want to do\n\n### 1: The limit embracing life\n\n- We need new ideas about how to think about the limited time we have and how we use it.\n- Each hour of life is a container on the conveyor belt of life that we feel we have to fill with something\n- Before timetables were existed, people were mostly task-oriented. Do the task when it is necessary, no scheduling\n- This gives rise to a sense of timelessness that Richard Rohr calls living in deep time. We get this sensation when we see big landscapes where we lose ourselves for a moment.\n- We have started treating time as a resource, and feel like we dont have enough or wasting too much. Trying to make better use of time, we push ourselves harder even when there is no need to. It never feels like you do well enough.\n- Accept reality: time is short, you will never do all you want. Be guided by the time it inherently takes to do something, called *Eigenzeit* in German. Resist the need to do everything, and let time be your guide.\n\n### 2: The Efficiency Trap\n\n- What is it?\n\t\t- We believe we can get more efficient at doing our tasks and then \"make time\" for the things that really matter.\n\t- Parkinson's law will ensure that work always baloons to fill the time available.\n\t- Hard choices should be made: you have to give up something to make time for something else.\n\t- Instead of getting things done, you will add more things to do\n- You will not get it all done; just focus on the ones that count\n- Existential overwhelm: You want the get all of life experiences and push yourself to do so. Life has infinite experiences to offer, you can't have all of them. Enjoy the tiny slices of experiences you actually do have\n- If the goal is to clear your to-do list, you will end up doing the meaningless small tasks first instead of the important ones. So accept the fact that your to-do list will always have things on it, just prioritize better on the important things\n- By using convenience tools to eradicate life's seemingly tedious tasks, you often remove meaning and connection from your life.\n\n### 3: Facing Finitude\n\n- The early part of this chapter focuses on the fact that life will ultimately end; momento mori- remember that you will die. This might serve as a reminder to people who live very fast paced lives without stopping to think.\n- It usually happens that you face a moment of clarity when faced with finitude, like death or a terminal illness. We should not wait until that moment to realize that time is our most valuable asset.\n\n### 4: Become a better procrastinator\n- learn to neglect the right things, or the *art of creative neglect*.\n\t- Pay yourself first when it comes to time.\n\t\t- Use your primetime hours to do what is most important to you\n\t\t- If you are waiting to start a creative project, a social cause or anything that matters to you, at a later date, \"when you have the time\", dont. Start today, however small.\n\t\t- Protect time by scheduling meetings with yourself\n\t- Limit your number of concurrent projects\n\t\t- Do not work on more than 3 concurrent projects at once. If you need to add more, remove one from the list first.\n\t\t- Feel free to abandon a project if it isnt working out\n\t\t- Limit the number of half-finished projects\n\t\t- Define your projects in managable chunks, and work on actively finishing them. Something like \"get better at music\" is too broad. Pick a song you want to learn. This would avoid the project from clogging up the system when something more interesting comes along\n\t- Learn to say no to projects you *do* want to do\n\t\t- There will be many projects that you will want to do\n\t\t- Learn to actively say no to them. This is the way to focus on your priorities\n- We fear committing to a single path in projects or relationships. We have the fear of missing out on possibilities that could have been. We live out a perfect fantasy in our heads, and escape when reality does not meet that perfect expectation. A fine example is Franz Kafka's relationship with his fiance Felice Bauer.\n- You must settle on something, in order to strive to get better at it. You have to commit to an instrument you want to play, for example. Switching all the time will scatter your efforts needlessly.\n- I disagree with Burkeman that one should have a child to \"settle\" and find happiness. Yes, children are great, but its a responsibiliy that not all are cut out or want to begin with.\n- Once you make a choice to settle on something, anxiety falls away and now you can move forward with purpose\n\n### 5: The watermelon problem\n- People spent 40 mins watching a TV show where people were putting rubber bands on a watermelon till it burst. This seeming utter waste of time, seems a much better source of entertainment than how we spend our time \"doomscrolling\" on social media.\n- What you apply your attention to, is what dictates how you spend your life energy. Social media is a machine designed to collect your attention reserves for profit, and most people give away too much of their attention (life energy) to social media without realizing it. \n\n### 6: The intimate interruptor\n- Why do we so readily get distracted from hard tasks (like our job, or reading, or pracitisng an instrument)? We are the ones that distract ourselves ultimately.  Burkeman suggests that this is because of our awareness of finitude.\n\t- I disagree with this dramatic explanation of a fact that is much better explained with how social media is designed to deliver instant dopamine hits which the mind starts to crave. Most tasks worth doing do not give instant gratificaation. Finitude has nothing to do with it. It's a weak explanation attempting to shoehorn this observation into the theme of this book.\n- Burkeman suggests that there is nothing we can do to avoid distracting ourselves all the time. That aall techniques such as focus music, meditation, etc are pointless.\n\t- I disagree with this because it has been shown that binaural beats increase focus, and meditation has far reaching impacts on the body and mind even if done only for 17 minutes a day (heard from Huberman lab podcast). Again, the author paints a hopeless picture that we are supposed to accept.\n- We distract ourselves from our work, because we know what we can achieve is finite and limited. We can build in our imagination a perfect world, but reality usually falls short and we avoid facing this reality.\n\n### 7: We never really have time\n- Douglas Hofstadter jokingly said- Any task will take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law. For example, the sydney opera house took 14 years instead of the planned 4 years.\n- In trying to plan everything ahead of time to perfection, so that you will be able to avoid an outcome you do not want, you often cause more anxiety to yourself instead of facing the actual consequencies would cause themselves.\n- We strive to control our time and refuse to accept our limitations. By trying to shape our future by controlling time today, which leads to anxiety. A simple cure to this anxiety is to realize that we will never be able to fully ensure our future outcomes\n- Uncertainity has brought us this far in life. We handled it once, and will surely handle it in the future. Learn to accept future outcomes even if it is not the ideal one you imagined.\n\n### 8: You are here\n- *Instrumentalizing time*: Using time as a means to achieve something in the future. This is a problem we all face.\n- Abandon the future-chasing mentality of \"when-i-finally\" to do something. There is no fixed task list that you can complete that will result in an overnight state of happiness.\n- Children are a great example of being in the present. Their purpose is to be a child. They dont worry about kindergarden, grade school, high school, college, etc. This kind of future chasing mentality comes from the parent.\n- Life is just a series of moments that you have to experience now. Being absent in the present and working towards a future benefit means that you will miss life itself.\n\n### 9: Rediscovering Rest\n\n- We have even taking the pleasure out of leisure by:\n\t- Pressurizing ourselves to extract the most out of our holiday time\n\t- Use our time off to get things done and be \"productive\"\n\t- Using leisure as a means to be more productive later\n- True leisure according to Aristotle is self-reflection and philisophical contemplation, and is the highest of virtues.\n- Medival peasants worked only for 150 days a year, but the industrial age meant that workers need to be in factories, and were allowed to do what they pleased with their time off as long as it didnt interrupt profits.\n- Todays concept of rest is only a means to recuperate from work, and be more productive when going back to it, or to improve ourselves for a future benefit. Anything that does not fit into this framework is viewed as wasteful.\n- To truly enjoy rest, you have to accept that this is it, and that you cannot work yourself towards a state of perfect happiness. Real rest, where we do nothing can feel uncomfortable at first, but that is a sign that you are doing it right.\n- It is worth undertaking 'atelic' activities, what are things you do for the sake of doing them alone, like hiking.\n\n### 10: The Impatience Spiral\n\n- We suffer from chronic impatience, where we honk at others for no reason, don't wait for the microwave timer to run out, inch towards cars at red lights, etc.\n- Technology has made things fast for us, but we still strive to go faster. Food reheats in a minute, but we would rather it took zero seconds. This impatience has led us to experience \"restlessness\" when we pick up a book to read, because reading is something that cannot be rushed. We are constantly submitting to interruptions, and using it as an excuse to avoid the discomfort that comes with something that takes time.\n- Working faster has become an addiction, where we believe that we need to work as hard and as fast as possible to survive, leading to anxiety, which only makes us work more. This phenomenon is celebrated society as being \"driven\"\n- Surrender to the reality that things will take the time they take. Reframe your perspective to relish the hard things in life that take time.\n\n### 11: Stay on the Bus\n\n- To be successful at the hard things, \"stay on the bus\". Stick with it longer than others can and will, while having the patience to face failure and imperfection and you will be successful after sufficient effort has been put into your endeavor.\n- Not being in control results in discomfort and we shy away from situations where patience and acceptance of the lack of control would be the better choice. Example, fixing an unknown problem, listening to your partner carefully, working on a difficult creative problem.\n- Three principles of patience:\n\t- Develop a taste for having problems. Learn to love them.\n\t- Embrace radical incrementalism. Be consistent in getting a little better everyday. The results will be staggering. Don't be impatient for dramatic results.\n\t\t- If you've dedicated a small time slot for consistently chipping away on a project, walk away when that time slot is done even if you're in the flow. The ability to do this everyday is more important that doing a lot in one day. Stopping helps develop the patience muscle to keep getting after it day after day.\n\t- Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality. Your initial work will always be unoriginal, but you have to \"stay on the bus\" long enough till true originality starts to emerge.\n\n### 12: The Loneliness of the Digital Nomad\n\n- Time is not useful if you are forced to experience it all on your own. It is a \"networked good\", whose value is higher when other people's time is shared and co-ordinated with yours (like a phone; it's no use having it all to yourself)\n- In the post-covid world, there is an increasing number of people who work from anywhere in the work, aka, the digital nomad. But people found that without a sense of community, it gets increasingly lonely.\n- In USSR, Stalin's chief economist, Yuri Larin,  suggested having a staggered day off in the week, so that the factories can run all week, and increase productivity. The result was the people were unhappy because their inner circle never had time off at the same time. Time off only makes sense if it is synced with others you want to spend your time with.\n- This is why Sweden's, *fika* works so well. In a fika, the entire workplace gathers at the same time in the day for coffee and cake, and they even get offended if people don't show up at a fika. You dont control your time off in this case, but it makes it very meaningful to connect with others.\n- Burkeman talks about keeping in sync during drills, in a choir, or in communal prayers where time feels more *vivid*, when it is filled with more meaning.\n- We need to draw a balance between individual and communal time to extract most meaning out of life. Too much of either can be detrimental to overall happiness.\n\n### 13: Cosmic Insignificance Theory\n\n-  In the time scale of the cosmos, our finite lives are truly insignificant, and the universe could not care less about what we do with our time.\n- Burkeman says that the whole of human civilization is about sixty lifetimes, and goes on to conclude that our own lifetime is nothing but a meaningless flicker.\n\t- This absolutely makes no sense. If all of human civilization is *only* sixty lifetimes, then each of our lives is absolutely meaningful, and what we do with our time can affect the course of human civilization, no matter in how miniscule a way.\n\t- He says if we realized how insignificant we are, we would not even be motivated to propagate our genes. Another absurd claim.\n- What does make sense is to not hold ourselves to a unrealisitic standard of what can be considered a significnat life well spent.\n\n### 14: The Human Disease\n\nBurkeman poses five questions that we can answer for ourselves to assess the reality of our finite-time situation:\n\n1. *‚ÄúWhere in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what‚Äôs called for is a little discomfort?‚Äù*  -- you want to make sure you're making choices that result in personal growth.\n2. *‚ÄúAre you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?‚Äù* -- be realisitic in what you can do.\n3. *‚ÄúIn what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?‚Äù* -- don't prove yourself to anyone, or meet expectations set by others, instead accept who you are and what you can achieve.\n4. *‚ÄúIn which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù* -- you may never reach mastery on a skill you're working on, so get started with what you have right now and do what you will with it.\n5. *‚ÄúHow would you spend your days differently if you didn‚Äôt care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?‚Äù* -- avoid being driven by results to achieve satisfaction; the journey is just as important.\n\n\n\n### Quotes\n\n\u003e‚ÄúWe labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life,‚Äù wrote Nietzsche, ‚Äúbecause to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe treat everything we‚Äôre doing‚Äîlife itself, in other words‚Äîas valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else.‚Äù -- in the context of instrumentalizing time.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúOur obsession with extracting the greatest future value out of our time blinds us to the reality that, in fact, the moment of truth is always now‚Äîthat life is nothing but a succession of present moments, culminating in death, and that you‚Äôll probably never get to a point where you feel you have things in perfect working order. And that therefore you had better stop postponing the ‚Äúreal meaning‚Äù of your existence into the future, and throw yourself into life now.‚Äù\n\n\u003e‚ÄúIn order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth‚Äù\n\n---\n### References\n\nOliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021, 1st Ed.","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Meyer-1976-Ch4":{"title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits","content":"![meyer](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KleHb8JHL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n- Bias circuits designed with current sources tend to be more insensitive to power-supply and temperature variations\n- For small currents, they tend to have a smaller on-chip footprint compared to resistor based techniques\n- As active loads, they provide high impedance, enabling high gain in voltage amplifiers\n\n\n\n## 4.2 Simple Current Source\n\n### ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\n\nTransistor Q1 is diode-connected which means that the collector-base voltage is zero.

He attributes their success to what he defines as **Deep Work**, which is defined as:\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúProfessional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.‚Äù\n\nHere are some examples of people who have had a tendency to go into deep focus modes when doing their work:\n1. Carl Jung, built a house for himself where he could isolate himself for work\n2. Mark Twain wrote in a shed away from the family, who had to blow a horn to alert him for meals\n3. Peter Higgs, physicist, was so isolated that people could not find him to tell him he had won the nobel prize\n4. Bill Gates stayed in his lakeside cottage for two \"Think Weeks\" in a year, from where he wrote the famous \"Internet Tidal Wave\" memo\n\nBut we live in a time where distraction is celebrated by being instantly responsive on communication platforms, and in contrast most knowledge workers perform **Shallow Work**, defined as,\n\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúNoncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.‚Äù\n\nIt appears that the modern world is permanently erasing our ability to perform Deep Work. Instead of nostalgically looking at our distraction-free past, deep work today has more meaning than ever before for two reasons:\n1. It is valuable to quickly learn complicated things\n2. In the digital age, creating valuable work has incredible reach- more than ever before\nIn the internet age, more and more people are becoming knowledge workers, and those who have the ability to do deep work, will stand out above the others. This is called the **Deep Work Hypothesis**.\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.‚Äù\n\nIt is notable that deep work does not mean long hours. It is a period of intense focus every for 3-4 hours a day, that is capable of producing valuable output. A deep life is a good life, as Newport says.\n\n### Deep Work is Valuable\n\nIn this section, three \"successful\" people are provided as examples, and the reason for their success is considered. Our future economy looks increasingly *divided* where easy to replicate jobs will be automated away, and hard to replicate jobs will become more valuable. Let's see who these people are and what makes them valuable.\n1. Nate Silver- a statistician who took his love of baseball to election predictions\n\t1. ==A highly skilled worker==, who is capable of taking data and manipulating it with machines to successfully predict new outcomes\n2. David Hansson- a programmer who created Ruby on Rails, used a lot to build the internet\n\t1. ==A superstar whose skillset is clearly at a premium==, and it often makes more economic sense to hire a superstar to get the job done instead of hiring a team of mediocre programmers not capable of that kind of output\n\t2. Everybody's skill today is traded on a \"universal bazaar\" where the best will clearly dictate a premium over all others\n3. John Doerr- a venture capitalist who fueled many major and successful tech companies\n\t1. ==A wealthy individual with lots of investable capital==, can fund a company like Instagram which sold for a billion dollars with only 13 people\n\nNot everyone has capital to invest, but the first two are definitely worth looking at. Our interest essentially lies in how we develop the ability to:\n1. quickly master hard things\n2. produce at an elite level (quality and speed)\n\nThe contrary is also important to consider and Newport states:\n\u003e[!quote] ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt produce, you won‚Äôt thrive‚Äîno matter how skilled or talented you are.‚Äù\n\nBoth of these skills essentially depends on our ability to do deep work.\n\nTo develop the ability to master hard things, we need to have\n1. Intense concentration where all our attention is solely focused on overcoming the challenge ahead of us, without distraction\n2. Deliberate practice to fail multiple times, use the feedback from the experience and correct your methods till you achieve success\n3. Neurological scaffolding called Myelin, which is a fatty tissue that develops around neurons when they are being used to do challenging tasks. Repeated work triggers oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around neurons\n\nNewport uses the example of Adam Grant, the youngest tenured prof at Wharton, who produced an absurdly high number of papers and a best selling book Give and Take. He takes the fall semester to do all his teaching and then all this research is batched into spring and summer. He also uses smaller batches to time to work deep, by putting out-of-office notices when he is working on a paper.\n\nThe reason you need long stretches of time to do deep work is due to attention residue. When you switch from one task to another, there is a residue left over from the previous task. This is entirely antithetical to the idea of multi-tasking where the semi-distracted state never lets you ultimately focus.\n\nWhat about Jack Dorsey? The twitter ex-CEO famously spends time in meetings and conversations with people doing what we define here as shallow work. He is still an effective leader and has proven he can disrupt the industry. Why? Deep work is not always applicable to all kinds of people in all roles. But in most circumstances deep work is usually valuable. There are always exceptions to the rule.\n\n### Deep work is rare\n\nToday's work culture is chock full of terms that are meant to keep people and ideas \"connected\" together; open workpaces, instant messaging, social media. Many organizations *require* their employees to respond instantly to emails and messages, and even to develop a social media presence, while not prioritizing deep work as a fundamental component of achieving productivity in a workplace.\n\nThe reason the companies do not see that the always-connected trend is detrimental to their business is due to the **metric black hole**, which is another way of saying that it is difficult to put a monetary value on the impact on the business causes by these office distractions which keep people away from deep work.\n\nWhat are some of the mental models that cause people to embrace distractions instead of deep work?\n- Principle of least resistance\n\t- Getting an answer to your question immediately makes your work easier, at least for the time being\n\t- People appear to be working when sending/receiving emails even if they have nothing else to show for work. Companies seem to permit working out of an email inbox.\n\t- Setting weekly meetings on the pretext of following up on projects is a proxy for staying on track with your own work, even if others have nothing to contribute in your meeting.\n- Busyness as a proxy for productivity\n\t- Knowledge work lacks real metrics to show that you have been productive\n\t- Being visibly busy is a viable option to prove to management that you are productive (even if you have nothing to show for it)\n- The cult of the internet\n\t- We have come to accept the \"internet\" as being good for us, often without considering the ramifications entirely.\n\t- This technopoly assumes that everyone should and will adopt the latest in technology because it is \"good\" for them (why won't you have a cell phone? do you know how convienient it is?)\n\nWith distractions from social media and the culture of connectivity in workplaces, deep work is becoming increasing rare, which is really bad for businesses. However, if everyone is always in a distracted state, those who are capable of deep work will suddenly find themselves in a fortunate position when they can produce at an elite level.\n\n### Deep work is meaningful\n\nEverything is not always about being successful and wealthy. Deep work is capable making a life meaningful and well worth living. The following arguments will prove that it is so, in a neurological, psychological and philosophical sense.\n\n**Neurological**: Science writer, Winifred Gallagher, in her book Rapt, says that our quality of life depends on what we pay attention to and what we ignore. Most often, we look at it backwards, ie, what happens to us should dictate how we feel. (There are some fMRI experiement arguments trying to support the neurological origin for this argument that does not make much sense.)\n\nDeep work allows your attention to focus on what is important, and ignore the minute stresses that are present in shallow work such as emails and instant messages. As such this results in an improved quality of life, because the small stuff does not stress us out throughout the day. A meaningful connection with your work can be very fulfilling.\n\n**Psychological**: When humans are deeply immersed in a challeging activity, they engage the limits of the mental powers while achieving what Csikszentmihalyi calls a *flow state* during which time takes on a different meaning, and a deep sense of satisfaction and happiness emerges.\n\n**Philosophical**: Sacredness has always been connected to meaning in the course of human culture, but since the evolution of Descartes' skepticism which put an individual over the importance of an all-knowing god, has led us to a life devoid of meaning. However, by dedicating ourselves to our craft, we can once again spark that connection to the sacredness and meaning.  Cultivating craftsmanship is a deep task that requires a commitment to deep work. It can be argued that our daily job is much too mundane to be sacred. This is because we have been led to believe that rarified jobs (nonprofits, startups, unique roles) are the only ones with meaning. Newport refutes this with\n\u003e[!quote] You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work\n\n### Rule 1: Work Deeply\n\nDavid Dewane envisions what he calls *The Eudaimonia Machine* which is an architectural concept for a workspace whose sole purpose is to enable deep work. The structure is a one-storey narrow rectangle with five rooms placed in a line, but there are no shared hallways. You need to pass through each room to get to the next one. The five rooms are\n1. *The Gallery*: contains examples of deep work produced in the building, to create a healthy mix of stress and peer pressure\n2. *The Salon*: a place to create intense curiousity and arguments that you will later develop deeper in the machine\n3. *The Library*: has records of all work produced in the machine, and has copies and scanners that you can use to collect material for your own deep work\n4. *The Office*: place to complete all the shallow work needed for your projects, email notes, webpage clippings, note collections.\n5. *The Chamber*: room with sound proof wall for total focus. The intention is to spend 90 minutes at a time and take a 90 minute break, and repeat this a few times a day will the brain has reached it's capacity for deep work.\n\nWe need to somehow emulate this process in our daily lives so that we can slip into deep work modes. We always have the urge to turn to something superficial, and this is the biggest obstacle to deep work. Roy Baumeister established that *willpower* is a finite resource that gets depleted as you use it. The key is to *not* rely on willpower to do deep work but instead develop a work habit that adds routines and rituals to put you in a state of intense concentration.\n\n==**Decide on your depth philosophy**==\n\nYou *must* decide on a depth philosophy that best suites your lifestyle and commitments. Here are some options:\n- Monastic\n\t- This is most suitable for people who have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that only comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well\n\t- Applies to people like Donald Knuth where he spends his time on computer programming or Neal Stephanson, writing science fiction novels. These people usually have a single point of focus in their lives (novels for Neal Stephanson; to produce accessible forms of computer science knowledge to people, for Donald Knuth)\n\t- This may not apply to people who have meetings to attend to at work, and other shallow commitments that are a requirement to fulfill\n- Bimodal\n\t- Define a clearly defined stretch of time in a week to deep work and leave the rest open to everything else. However, the amount of time has to be substantially long (at least a full day) for one to reach maximum cognitive load.\n\t- This method of deep work is best suited to those who have committments that involve shallow tasks, whether they like it or not (most people).\n\t- Carl Jung used split his time between his retreat and treating patients in his clinic. Adam Grant, the Wharton professor, split his time between teaching in fall, and research in summer and spring. They used bimodal depth philosophies.\n\t- The key to making this work is to make yourself unavailable during deep work periods, and totally accessible during open work times. The hope is people working with you will come to accept this work modality.\n- Rhythmic\n\t- In this philosophy, you commit yourself to habits where you work deeply at a prescribed time. You could also create for yourself a calendar where you mark your deep work, and as you build up a work streak, you will be hesitant to break it.\n\t- The mode of work is most suitable to office workers\n\t- This seems to be a very short time-scale implementation of the bimodal approach. The difference between this method and the bimodal method is elucidated clearly by Newport.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach will not produce the level of depth that bimodal would, but this form of work is much more suitable to reality.\n\t\t- Rhythmic approach is capable of logging more deep work hours in a given year compared to bimodal, by its sheer repetitive nature.\n- Journalistic\n\t- Here, you fit in deep work at any time you get a chance to. You should have the ability to quickly sink into deep concentration and work deeply. \n\t- This is something that is only acquired by practice and is not often suitable for a beginner. A beginner will likely quickly deplete willpower reserves. Also, one must have the conviction that the work at hand is important, which usually only happens to already accomplished people.\n\t- The journalist Walter Issacson apparently worked on his book any chance he got. Newport also admits to using this technique to write this book. Although not as spontaneous, he mapped out in advance any free time he had to write this book.\n\n**==Ritualize==**\n\nCompletely ignore the need for inspiration to do deep work, and create idiosyncratic rituals to minimize all friction in getting to work. A ritual can be designed around the following considerations:\n1. Specify a location for your deep work, and decide how long you will work.\n2. Define rules and metrics, such as no internet, external communication, or words typed in a fixed time interval\n3. Minimize all friction required to do work. Use good stationary, appropriate computer peripherals, computer files ready to go, coffee if you need it.\n\nThese principles cement into your mind that your deep work is the highest priority and needs this kind of committment.\n\n**==Make Grand Gestures==**\n\nIncrease the perceived importance of a task by making a *grand gesture* that often involves significant effort or energy. Here are some fun examples:\n- J.K. Rowling checked nto the 5-star Balmoral Hotel to finish the last Harry Potter book. Physicist \n- Physicist and novelist, Alan Lightman retires to a remote island in Maine with no phone access. \n- William Shockley invented the junction transistor by locking himself in a Chicago hotel. \n- Entrepreneur Peter Shankman found that he wrote best when on a plane. So to meet a deadline, he booked a round trip flight to Japan and wrote for the next 30 hours.\n\n**==Don't Work Alone==**\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-Tsividis-1987-Ch1":{"title":"Operation and Modeling of the MOS Transistor","content":"\n![tsividis](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wL-KP1sNL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg)\n\n\n## 1.2 Semiconductors\n\nWe will deal with silicon as semiconductor, and assume that it is in thermal equilibrium without any external influences.\n\n### Properties of semiconductors\n\n- A silicon crystal has a lattice of atoms held together in a three-dimensional structure called a [[crystal lattice]].\n- Atoms are held together using a [[valence bond]] associated with the electron of the atom. In absolute zero, these electrons exactly counteract the positive charge in the electron's nucleus\n- With thermal energy, the electron is knocked loose from the atom and becomes a [[free electron]] which can now freely move throught the lattice, and can cause electric current to flow\n- The resulting positive charge is called a [[hole]] and can also move through the lattice by electrons from neighboring atoms filling the hole and becoming positive themselves.\n\n\n\n\n## 1.5 The PN junction\n\n### Without external bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-no-external-bias.png]]\n\n- N-type and P-type semiconductors are brought together to make a PN junction. When the doping changes from one type to another abruptly it is called a *step* junction.\n- There are metallic contacts on either extreme of materials where connection to the external world is made.\n- Due to the concentration difference across the interface of these two regions:\n\t- Electrons will diffuse from the n-region to the p-region, leaving behing positivitly charged donor atoms\n\t- Holes will diffuse from the p-region to the n-region leaving behind negatively charged acceptor atoms\n- An electric field builds up internal to the PN junction due to the ionized impurities in either region, and the direction of the field goes from the n- to p-region.\n\t- Any further holes diffusing from p- to n-type, will be repelled by this field\n\t- Any further electron diffucing from n- to p-type will be repelled by this field\n- The potential difference across this region is called the ==built-in potential== of the junction, and is denoted by $\\phi_{bi}$.\n\t$$\\phi_{bi} = \\phi_{Fp}-\\phi_{Fn}$$\n\twhere, $\\phi_{Fp}$ and $\\phi_{Fn}$ are the Fermi potentials of the p-side and n-side respectively.\n- This will result in a region in each doped semiconductor which is devoid of any free charges. This is called the ==depletion region==.\n* If n-type is more heavily doped (as shown in figure), then the depletion width $d_1$ in the n-type region is lesser than $d_2$ in the p-type region, because there are more carriers per unit area, which means more charge can be uncovered in relatively short depth. \n* If n-type is heavily doped so that $N_D \u003e\u003e N_A$,  then most of the potential is dropped across the p-type region, and $\\phi_2 \\approx \\phi_{bi}$\n* The depletion width $d_1$ will be very small and $d_2$ can be calculated as :\n$$\nd_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s}{qN_A}}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n- The charge per unit area on the p-side is given by\n$$\nQ'_2=-\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_sN_A}\\sqrt{\\phi_{bi}}\n$$\n\n### With forward bias\n\n![[images/pn-junction-forward-bias.png]]\n\n- If a positive voltage V is applied to the p-side, the junction is forward biased\n- The external voltage will lower the builtin potential to $\\phi_{bi}-V$\n- The electrons supplied from the negative terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some of the charges in the depletion region on the n-side, and the holes supplied from the positive terminal of the battery will \"cover\" some charges in the depletion region on the p-side\n- The overall depth of the depletion regions on each side will decrease\n- Electrons and holes do not face as much as a potential barrier and will cross over from one side to the other in the pn junction resulting in the flow of current which is\n$$\nI = I_0(e^{V/\\phi_t}- 1)\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ depends on the pn junction doping and geometry, and $\\phi_t$ is the thermal voltage.\n\n### With reverse bias\n![[images/pn-junction-reverse-bias.png]]\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/B-razavi-microelec-2013-Ch9":{"title":"Fundamentals of Microelectronics","content":"\n![razavi-microelec](https://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/47/11196951/1119695147.jpg)\n\n## ![[permanent/Need for Current Mirrors in Microelectronics]]\n\n- The biasing provided to circuits should be independent of:\n\t- Voltage variation: Eg, the voltage from a battery drops as it discharges slowly\n\t- Temperature variation: Eg, different environments / places have different ambient temperatures\n\n- How does temperature affect the operation of circuits?\n\t- ![[images/impractical-biasing-of-mos-bjt-transistors.jpeg]]\n\t\n\t* BJT example\n\t\t* For a desired current $I_1$,\n\t\t\t* $$\n\t\t\t\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{cc}=V_T ln\\frac{I_1}{I_S}\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t* even if resistors are made of same material, and vary the same amount, $V_T$ and $I_S$ vary with temperature, resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\t- FET example\n\t\t- For a desired current $I_1$\n\t\t\t- $$\n\t\t\tI_1= \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_nC_{ox}(\\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{DD}-V_{TH})^2\n\t\t\t$$\n\t\t- Even if resistors vary the same amount, mobility $\\mu_n$ and threshold voltage $V_{TH}$ vary with temperature resulting in varying current $I_1$\n\n- It is possible to design a circuit called [[Band Gap Reference]] that can provide voltage- and temperature independent voltage and currents, but this uses 10's of transistors and is fairly complex.\n-  The idea is to generate a golden reference current (or voltage) from a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit, and merely \"copy\" that reference current to wherever it is needed in the whole circuit. The circuit that does the copying is called a current mirror\n\n\n---\n\n## ![[permanent/Working principle of a Current Mirror]]\n\nThe basic idea is to use the current generated from a golden source like a bandgap reference circuit and use that to generate a voltage, which will then be applied to another transistor to generate a copy of the current.\n\n### Circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the logarithm of its input current\n\n![[images/output-voltage-proportional-to-input-current.jpeg|200x200]]\n\nA diode connected bipolar transistor does exactly this. The relationship of voltage $V_1$ to the current $I_{ref}$ is \n$$\nV_1 = V_Tln\\frac{I_{REF}}{I_{S,REF}}\n$$\nwhere $I_{S,REF}$ is the saturation current of the reference transistor.\n\nLet us construct the whole current source now.\n![[images/bjt-current-source.jpeg|400]]\n\nThe voltage at the base of transistors Q1 and Q2 is proportional to the natural logarithm of the reference current from the bandgap reference circuit, and is a result of the diode connected transistor Q1. Transistor Q2 takes the voltage at its base and creates a \"copy\" or \"mirrors\" the current to the output side, provided transistors Q1 and Q2 are identical to each other, or some integer multiple thereof.\n\nSo, how does this solve the temperature sensitivity issue? The voltage at the base of the transistors does vary with temperature. But since Q1 and Q2 are identical, they are affected in the same way by temperature. As a result, the copied current is insensitive to temperature.\n\n## ![[permanent/Using a current mirror to create multiple copies, multiples, or fractions of a reference current]]\n\n- Once the $V_{BE}$ voltage has been generated from the reference current (that uses bandgap reference) using the diode connected transistor, it can be used as the $V_{BE}$ for several output transistors.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5, then you can create 3 copies of the reference current.\n\t- If you apply the voltage to several transistors Q3, Q4, Q5 and then tie their collectors together, you can create one 3X copy of the reference current\n\t- If you size the reference transistor to be 3 parallel transistors, and have only one output transistor, you can generate fractional 1/3 current copies.\n\t- If you have a reference transistor of size 3X, and output transistors of size 1X and 12X, you can generate both multiplier and fractional current copies (1/3rd and 4X in this case)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Effect of base current\n\n# References\n\n- Behzad Razavi, Fundamentals of Microelectronics, 2013, Wiley, Chapter 9\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/C-Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch":{"title":"Introduction to PyTorch","content":"\n*This course was offered to Qualcomm employees as Engineering Development*\n\n### Terminology\n\n[[Artificial Intelligence]] : This is a field of study where machines mimic the intelligence of humans by learning and performing tasks based on the experience or data they are provided.\n\n[[Machine Learning]]: This is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, where the emphasis is on computers learning from data that is provided to them, so that they can perform intelligent tasks such as classifications and predictions.\n\n[[Deep Learning]]: This is a subset of machine learning where computers learn to perform specific tasks, but can perform much more complex (deep) tasks based on the rudimentary building blocks of learning.\n\nOther machine learning approaches involve decision tree based models, and even linear models such as curve fits and regressions still count as [[AI/ML]].\n\n### Principles of Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning draws a very good analogue with Lego blocks. The idea to use pieces to make simple things and then use those simple things to create something more complex. The hierarchy of components one could hypothetically build can be quite \"deep\", and this is where the name comes from. \n\nWhen building a learning model from simpler learning models, the \"pieces\" have to \"fit\" together much like lego blocks do. A simple piece of a learning model can be built with two fundamental operations:\n1. Matrix multiplication\n2. Activation function\n\nThis simple piece constructed from the basic operations above is called a ==fully connected layer==.\n\nTo push the lego analogy further, you can connect several fully-connected layers to build what is called a ==multi-level perceptron-==.\n\nOne of the highly cited papers that shows this Lego action in practice is Szegedy et al 2014 (insert Zotero link). They describe the design of the Inception multilevel perceptron used to classify images.\n\nOne of the other important advantages of Deep Learning is that the learning model only gets better with more and more training data.  This is in contrast to other models like Tree-Based models that stop getting better after a certain amount of data. Also, for decision tree based ML, one cannot sufficiently cover all possible scenarios with \"if\" conditions. The model simply does not get better anymore. xkcd.com/1838\n\n\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/P-Protocol-and-Tools-to-Optimize-Physical-Health":{"title":"Fitness toolkit: Protocol and Tools to Optimize Physical Health","content":"## What is a [[Foundational Protocol]] for fitness?\n\nA foundational protocol for fitness is a workout routine that optimizes all protocol types (listed below). It serves as a basis to hit all the important requirements from an exercise routine, to optimize health and fitness. A beginner starting out, or an individual who is solely interested in staying fit, and not really training for specialized athletic performance should simply follow the foundational protocol for fitness. If you are trying to be more specific, like train for a marathon, or simply build muscle for asthetics, then the exercise routine required will simply overweight the equivalent protocol for that purpose (eg, weight training for muscular [[hypertrophy]])\n\n## What are the different fitness protocol types?\n\n1. Skill\n2. Speed\n3. Strength\n4. Power (Speed x Strength)\n5. Hypertrophy\n6. Muscular Endurance\n7. Aerobic Endurance\n\t1. Over 30 mins (high heart rate)\n\t2. Over 30 mins (lower heart rate)\n\n## How can a weekly workout be designed to hit all these protocols?\n\n### Day 1: Aerobic Endurance (Low heart rate)\nThe main purpose is to maintain [[Zone 2]] heart rate for an extended period of time. You can get this from rowing, cycling or jogging for 60-75 mins. Alternatively, you can go on a long hike (2-3 hours) to mix it up. If you really find that easy, use a weighted vest or a ruck sack during the long hike.\n\n### Day 2: Hypertrophy - Lower Body\nPrimarily focus on weights and do a heavy volume set to really push legs close to failure on 2-3 sets at least. The main purpose is to target the quads, hamstring and calves. \n\nLeg muscles are very large musicles and working them out early in the week sets up for better metabolism and hormones throughout the week. But make sure that legs are not too tired from Day 1 exercise.\n\n### Day 3: Heat and Cold Cycling  (Recovery)\nThe purpose here is to activate various mechanisms involved in hot and cold therapy for which there is a lot of material out there. But essentially, do a 20 min sauna followed by a 45-50F ice bath. Do not go colder on this until you are sure you will not get hypothermia. This will also accelerate recovery from a leg workout the previous day. Maybe go for a walk to ensure that you hit a target of 200m [[Zone 2]] cardio in the week.\n\n### Day 4: Hypertrophy - Upper Body\nDo a weight training session for the torso, where you will do bench / shoulder presses, bent over rows, pull ups, etc. Ensure that you getting both pushing and pulling (or eccentric and concentric) exercises. Do a good heavy volume set that will build your chest and back muscles. Note that we are not working out biceps / triceps etc here.\n\n### Day 5:  Aerobic/Muscular Endurance (High heart rate)\nDo a run, row or cycle where your heart rate is much higher than Zone 2 and is typically about 80% of your heart rate maximum (calculated as 220-age). So for a 40 year old, that would be a sustained heart rate of ~145bpm.\n\n\n---\n\n### Day 6: Speed, Strength, Power (High intensity, Max HR, 2nd leg day)\nDo a [[HIIT]] style training with a focus on working out the legs specifically. One simple example is you can sprint with maximum effort for 30s and rest for 10s, and repeat this for 5 times at least. The goal is to do explosive exercises for your legs generally, and keep the volume low. But you will aim to hit absolute maximum heart rate (~180bpm for a 40 year old) for at least a few minutes, till you feel your heart wanting to explode out of your chest. With the focus on legs, this will serve as a 2nd lower body workout too.\n\n### Day 7: Hypertrophy - Arms, Calves, Neck\nThis is the second day of hypertrophy for upper body with an emphasis on biceps, triceps, calves, and neck. Yes, neck muscles are very important to be strong too. It may save you from whiplash and maybe even death.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE]\n\u003e Concepts are few, but methods are many\n\u003e *Andy Galpin*\n\n## What are some general training guidelines useful for this?\n\n- For a 1 hour workout session, do about 10 mins of warmup followed by 50 mins of ==hard work==.\n- For muscle work, do it twice a week for upper and lower body. First time, do heavy weights and high intensity. Second time, do moderate weights but [[HIIT]] style.\n- When picking exercises, use both push and pull types of exercies. Loading on both concentric and eccentric motions are important.\n- Use an alternating weight strategy every month, to keep it simple and reduce injury.\n\t- Odd months : Lower reps, heavy weights -\u003e more sets, long rest times (2-4mins)\n\t- Even months: Higher reps, lower weights -\u003e fewer sets, short rest times (0.5-2mins)\n- Limit your exercises to only those you **can** do, and do it **==WITH PERFECT FORM==**\n\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/literature/P-Resistance-Training-Patrick":{"title":"Resistance training for time efficiency, body composition, and maximum hypertrophy with Brad Schoenfeld","content":"\n### Why should we be resistance training?\n\n- If you were to pick one form of exercise, it should be resistance training\n- It gives all benefits of cardio in addition to:\n\t- Muscle and bone strength\n\t\t- Osteoporosis (esp for women) is a possibility with age\n\t\t- Resistance training makes muscle pull on the bone, and strengthens the bone\n\t\t- Weight bearing exercise strengthens bone, not other forms of exercise\n\t\t- Cycling, swimming, and other forms of cardio does not help bone density, maybe running is ok to some extent\n\t\t- Compound motions like squats, rows, presses, pushups are very helpful for bone density\n\t\t- Even \u003e70 yr olds see massive improvements in muscle strength when they start lifting, in 8-12 weeks, even if they have never training before.\n\t\t\t- But always start early.

Exercise is adjunct at that point. \n- Cardio is more for increasing energy expenditure.\n- It is important to combine resistance training with calorie restriction to contribute to weight loss. If you do only cardio and no resistance training, you will lose both muscle and fat. No recomposition will happen. Resistance training maintains muscle mass.\n- The more weight you have to lose, the easier it is to recomp.\n- If you have been training for a long time, then it is harder to recomp. Noob gains is a real thing.\n- If you want to bulk up, then you cannot guarantee that you will maximize muscle. You need to be at equal calorie needs or at a slight surplus.\n\n### Nutrition requirements for muscle mass\n- Can I have plenty of protein intake while meeting calorie deficit, but not do resistance training?\n\t- No. You have to do resistance training.\n\t- but it really depends, maybe if you are very obese then you will lose fat first\n\t- But even if you are normal, you need a lot of protein to maintain muscle\n- Need 1.6-1.8g / kg which is about 2X the RDA. No really downsides, no liver damage, etc.\n\t- This number is calculated for people who are lean - about 15-20% body fat. If you are obese, then you need to target the lower weight for protein intake calculations.\n\t- Protein is very diffcult to store as body fat.\n\t- Older people need even more protein due to reduced anabolism. They need more leucine to kickstart the muscle growth.\n- Whole foods are the best for protein intake, but protein shakes are ok if you are not meeting your requirements.\n- Dont need leucine supplements if you are taking in animal based protein. They are quality proteins that are rich in leucine.\n- 4oz of chicken = 30g of protein\n\n---\n# References","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null},"/permanent/Common-pitfalls-in-note-taking-methods":{"title":"Common pitfalls in note taking methods","content":"\n### 1.

The model describes drain current overshoots induced when turning on the transistor gate and suggests a novel extraction method for the recombination lifetime in the silicon film.‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1198](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY))\n\n[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1198\u0026annotation=GF3Q3W3B)‚ÄúThe experiment consists in maintaining the SOI MOSFET back gate grounded, whereas the front gate is switched from depletion or accumulation regime to strong inversion (Fig. 1). The minority carriers needed in the inversion channel are rapidly supplied by the heavy doped source/drain regions. The positive pulse on the front gate leads to the depletion region extension, but in the case of a PD SOI film, the majority carriers expelled from this region cannot be removed instantaneously and are stored in the neutral body. This induces a temporary increase in the body potential, , which lowers the threshold voltage and results in excess drain current (Fig. 1). Equilibrium is reached through carrier recombination for removing the excess majority carriers.‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1198](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) This describes the physical reasons why drain current overshoots and how recombination effects bring it back to steady state\n\n [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1199\u0026annotation=ZRNFEIB7)  \n([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1199](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY)) Figure shows show the depletion region widens when a positive pulse is applied at the gate. The excess holes in the body raises the body potential, resulting in a threshold voltage drop, and drain current overshoot.\n\n[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FZ7E4S47?page=1199\u0026annotation=BWKVMIXF)‚ÄúThe transient duration is essentially governed by the carrier recombination lifetime in the silicon film [13], [16]: lower the lifetime, lower the recovery time‚Äù ([Munteanu and Ionescu, 2002, p. 1199](zotero://select/library/items/IZJVHYUY))","lastmodified":"2023-01-11T06:16:45.985322022Z","tags":null}}
