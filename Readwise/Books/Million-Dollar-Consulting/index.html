Consultants are experts, not mere advice givers.</li><li>Consultant: An expert in one or more identified areas who partners with a client to improve the client’s condition.</li><li>Once you walk away from a successful engagement, the client’s “state” should be better than it was when you got there</li><li>If you work on an important issue with zero transfer of skills, you’re simply an independent expert (upper left). You ski, but you can’t teach me to ski</li><li>If you transfer significant skills but not for an important issue (lower right) then you’re an interventionist</li><li>You’ve done these things yourself and can teach them. But you teach them generically, not because there is an urgent issue at the moment.</li><li>The upper right, collaborator, represents the real value in consulting, where you are both transferring skills and doing so as a vital issue is resolved. That’s where the highest value and concomitant highest fees reside.</li><li>Expertise: Great consultants teach others how to do what they do and do not create codependencies. Counterintuitively, the more intellectual property you transfer, the more the client will value you.</li><li>if you charge by the hour you’re an amateur</li><li>When expertise becomes so obvious and apparent that the consultant is sought out by clients, a powerful brand has been created, based on the allure of one’s expertise. When that happens, credibility, terms, fees, and other factors are no longer any kind of obstacle or barrier.</li><li>the secret to Million Dollar Consulting as a metaphor is that you have to continually work smarter, not harder</li><li>The progression often looks like this (read from bottom to top):
•   Retainer
•   Project oversight
•   Project implementation
•   Work at client request
•   Subcontractor</li><li>1.   Streamline Your Business<ul><li>Note: Do only as much work as is necessary. Streamline your labor. Strive to minimize it. Work smart, not hard.</li></ul></li><li>2.   Delegate Work to the Client<ul><li>Note: Most clients will have better las resources and technicians to get lab measurements and things like that done, doing it myself will be a major pain!</li></ul></li><li>3.   Subcontract<ul><li>Note: Get other people to do some of the grunt work, Or if you know someone better of it, just let them do it.</li></ul></li><li>You require three things to be successful in this business:
•   Passion. You must love what you do.
•   Competency. You must be good at what you do.
•   Need. You must identify or create client need.<ul><li>Note: For modeling work, I have reasonable passion and high level of competency. Is there a need though?</li></ul></li><li>the great careers in consulting are built around what you love to do and are great at doing. It is not a process of continual addition, but actually one of culling.</li><li>Carve away everything that you aren’t great at and don’t love, and you’ll create the artwork of your career.</li><li>To begin, state your value proposition. This is a brief statement of how the buyer is improved after you leave, hence, it is always a business outcome or result, never an input or deliverable<ul><li>Note: My value proposition: greatly improve chances of first pass design success!</li></ul></li><li>Your ideal buyer is that economic buyer who can spend money for your value proposition<ul><li>Note: Rf design teams in small to mid size companies without design support. Ideally, it will be the technical engineering lead, or vp of the engineering department.</li></ul></li><li>Buying lists for a few pennies per name from people overseas may seem like a bargain, but it is not, for two reasons: The first reason is that cold-calling doesn’t work. But the second is that such lists are never useful in terms of your ideal buyers.</li><li>Let’s be clear: We do not grow and prosper by correcting weaknesses; we grow and prosper by building on strengths</li><li>determine your “sweet spot,” which is what you are great at doing consistently</li><li>The “spokes” around the sweet spot are factors or components of it</li><li>What intellectual property (IP) will support those components?</li><li>Expertise: IP doesn’t exist, and isn’t created, in a vacuum. It should be created within your competency and passion to support your name and brand.</li><li>The recognition of your value proposition (your passion around your contribution), your ideal buyer (the person who will invest in your passion because there is perceived need that exists or you create), and your sweet spot (the thing you’re great at doing and want to do and that gives you great satisfaction), is the heart of your success in growing a solo practice and/or a boutique firm</li><li>Marketing is the art and science of creating need. You can reach out to people to do this, but it’s far more effective to attract them to you</li><li>the effective strategy is “Build it and tell them you’ve built it, and they will come.”<ul><li>Note: I need to create a consistent stream of content via blogs and videos and post that linked in telling people what built i&rsquo;v</li></ul></li><li>When buyers approach you because they’ve heard of you and are interested in your value (gravity), they seldom look into credibility or inquire about fees</li><li>market gravity</li><li>Commercial publishing<ul><li>Note: I could write for microwave journal, ee Times microwave magazine and publish articles there.</li></ul></li><li>Speaking</li><li>Web presence</li><li>Word of mouth</li><li>Teaching</li><li>Networking</li><li>Referrals</li><li>all of these (and other) gravity factors, referrals, networking, and speaking have the best potential for short-term business and fairly rapid cash.</li><li>Expertise: The accelerant curve does not arise by default. It must be consciously planned and examined for adjustment as you become more successful.</li><li>Brand creation begins with the three components we discussed earlier: passion, competency, and market need</li><li>Brand creation</li><li>Brand building</li><li>Brand equity</li><li>Expertise: It’s never too early or too late to create, refine, and/or abandon brands. Monitor their effectiveness constantly.</li><li>A brand enables market gravity to more readily attract people to you, and when people knock on your door, credibility is assumed and fees are whatever you say they are.</li><li>you are building a solo practice, which will generate cash for you every year but which obviously won’t be sold since it consists only of you, work toward your name as the brand</li><li>your value proposition</li><li>you identify what you are great at</li><li>Carve away everything else</li><li>Find your ideal buyers</li><li>Use market gravity</li><li>Place them on your Accelerant Curve</li><li>Expertise: The steps are easy, but we keep getting distracted by squirrels</li><li>many consultants have a bad case of the “imposter syndrome</li><li>The smaller the project, the more demanding the client</li><li>We think the project is easy. It rarely is</li><li>magic bullet</li><li>You have to be happy and well to treat others well, because this is the ultimate relationship business</li><li>An economic buyer is a person who has the ability to write a check (have a check issued) for your value without the approval of anyone else</li><li>How do we create the same levels of trusting relationship that exist with longtime clients in brand-new prospects</li><li>Create evangelists</li><li>Provide opportunity</li><li>Use testimonials, references, and case studies shamelessly</li><li>here’s how to accelerate the positive, trusting relationship that existing buyers already have with you:</li><li>Create a peer-to-peer dynamic</li><li>Always keep in mind that you are there to offer value</li><li>Gauge the other person’s sense of speed</li><li>Guide the conversation</li><li>Show confidence</li><li>Push back when appropriate</li><li>what’s required is someone suggesting that the buyer’s alternative is not the best, his or her evaluation not valid, his or her suppositions not based on empirical evidence</li><li>It’s important to regard your existing buyer, in most cases, as a prospect as well.</li><li>that you can be of help in additional areas and dimensions</li><li>two buyers a week on average</li><li>if you see your existing buyers also as prospective buyers, and if you include them to the maximum degree in your two-buyers-a-week drill, you will significantly improve the percentage of new business that results. It’s all in the numbers.</li><li>two sales are made when you successfully conclude an agreement</li><li>The first occurs when the proposal is signed and you receive your check to begin. The second occurs when you derive referral and repeat business from that buyer.
Too often, consultants ignore or forget the second sale, thereby denying themselves half of the business potential</li><li>You should have been meeting the buyer’s peers, subordinates, and relevant others during your tenure</li><li>Follow your buyers to new positions within the same organization or in new ones</li><li>Assiduously create referral business</li><li>Elicit contemporary testimonials, case studies, and war stories as your tenure progresses</li><li>offer to “debrief” and bring the new person up to speed on the project and its trajectory</li><li>Never cease marketing to new prospects</li><li>In any one year, a ratio of about 80 percent repeat business and 20 percent new business is quite good.</li><li>Pro bono work<ul><li>Note: Can I use a model of doing a 2 week period for free and then letting them continue if like what I do? I will only need to do this for a short while till business referrals pick up.</li></ul></li><li>Create and nurture your “evangelist” group</li><li>Proposals are most effective when they satisfy personal objectives of the buyer in additional to business issues</li><li>However, true, sustaining trust is built on an emotional connection. Think of it as the honest belief that the other person has your best interests in mind</li><li>You can’t be a supplicant or appear obsequious. You should appear as a peer of the buyer. That means your examples should be relevant to his or her level and situation, and your frames of reference should be appropriate for the industry. For</li><li>Don’t allow the conversation to drift out of your channel.</li><li>To control the conversation, you also need to interrupt the buyer. That’s right, interrupt</li><li>Otherwise, with the best of intentions, polite discourse could take you to territories uncharted and far removed from your intended destination.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://notes.vsekar.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Vikram Sekar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://notes.vsekar.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vikramskr>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vik-s>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
