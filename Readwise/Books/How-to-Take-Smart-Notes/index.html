earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument
is the smallest part of its development.</li><li>This book aims to fill this gap by
showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into
convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected
notes along the way.</li><li>those who take smart
notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again</li><li>The
right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even
years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best
possible position to write a great paper easily?</li><li>They struggle because they believe, as they are made to
believe, that writing starts with a blank page.</li><li>good, productive writing is based on good note-taking</li><li>The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends
more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a
decision on the topic.</li><li>What does make a
significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else:
how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand</li><li>there is no measurable correlation between a high
IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120.</li><li>self-control and
self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with
ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed.</li><li>Not having willpower, but not
having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.</li><li>A
good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of
remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you
can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and
you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the
ideas.</li><li>A good structure enables flow,</li><li>If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself;
it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push
yourself and employ willpower.</li><li>The challenge is to structure one’s
workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that
push us forward.</li><li>How do you plan for insight, which, by definition,
cannot be anticipated?</li><li>a
system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information,
which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim
of generating new ideas.</li><li>Dunning-Kruger effect</li><li>high achievers
who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to
suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome</li><li>overly
confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their
abilities.</li><li>There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have.
Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway.</li><li>The first idea lies at the heart of
this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box.</li><li>Even the best tool will not improve your
productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded
in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads
to drive it on.</li><li>as soon as you get used to taking
smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that you will wonder how you
were ever able to get anything done before.</li><li>The
importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s
“Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001)</li><li>And this
is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if
you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go
and let you focus on the task at hand.</li><li>What
we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a
successful organization lies in the holistic perspective</li><li>Niklas Luhmann</li><li>he turned note-taking on its head.
Instead of adding notes to existing categories or the respective texts, he
wrote them all on small pieces of paper, put a number in the corner and
collected them in one place: the slip-box.</li><li>He realised that one idea, one
note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context
it was taken from.</li><li>I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how
to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something
else.”</li><li>We are still so used to
the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not to believe
that a simple change in our work routines could not only make us more
productive, but the work also more fun.</li><li>success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability
to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments
that avoid resistance in the first place</li><li>This is
not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right
workflow</li><li>if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise
your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in
your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just
can’t be compensated by a high IQ.
As</li><li>Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained
the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main
one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what
he read.</li><li>Whenever
he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of
a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013,
170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box</li><li>In
a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about
their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the
main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of
paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the
paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of
the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single
sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.</li><li>He
usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the
slip-box.</li><li>And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with
great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full
sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his
material.</li><li>He then would add
references</li><li>to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were
located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were
directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious
connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.</li><li>He
did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a
transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation
where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the
original meaning as truthfully as possible.</li><li>The
trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather
abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were
only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or
directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or
addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.</li><li>Whenever
he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make
possible connections between them</li><li>The
last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one
or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought
or topic.</li><li>We need a reliable and
simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of
our brains</li><li>Make fleeting notes.<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>These
are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not
cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox,
and process them later.</li><li>Make literature notes<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Whenever you read
something, make notes about the content.</li><li>Keep it very
short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.</li><li>Be extra selective with
quotes</li><li>Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place –
your reference system.</li><li>Make permanent notes<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Now turn to your
slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day
and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what
is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.</li><li>The
idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions</li><li>Write exactly one note for each idea</li><li>Now add your new permanent notes to the
slip-box<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does
not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one</li><li>Adding links to related notes.</li><li>either linking
to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an
entry point</li><li>is itself linked to the index.</li><li>Develop your topics, questions and research
projects bottom up from within the system<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises
the most insight</li><li>Look through the connections and collect all
the relevant notes on this topic<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>copy them onto your “desktop”[6]
and bring them in order.<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Turn your notes into a rough draft.<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Edit and proofread your manuscript<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>If writing is the medium of research
and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as
if nothing else counts than writing.</li><li>Even if you decide never to write a
single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other
intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than
writing.</li><li>will make you more engaged</li><li>learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from
actual good ones</li><li>read in a more
engaged way</li><li>much more likely that you will remember</li><li>do what you do deliberately</li><li>In
the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the
new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it
again?</li><li>The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system
organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the
more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing.</li><li>It can only play out its strengths when
we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of
notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled</li><li>Fleeting
notes</li><li>Permanent notes</li><li>Project notes</li><li>Nothing motivates us more than the experience
of becoming better at what we do</li><li>Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better
(which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being
praised (which is outwardly rewarding).</li><li>Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks
tend to occupy our short-term memory</li><li>The brain doesn&rsquo;t distinguish
between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By
writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads.</li><li>ego
depletion</li><li>It is well
known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks,</li><li>Breaks are
much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning</li><li>As literature notes are also a
tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense
in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just
jot down some keywords</li><li>Whenever we explore a new,
unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t
get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we
cannot skip. Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a
difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single
sentence</li><li>You need to take
some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so
you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box
note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself</li><li>indiscriminate gathering of any relevant
information regardless of what argument it will support</li><li>The
slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant
notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting
thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw
conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.</li><li>while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing
it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as
ineffectual.</li><li>In
short: Pure re-viewing just doesn’t make any sense, neither for understanding
nor for learning</li><li>the best-researched and most successful
learning method is elaboration</li><li>The objection that it takes
too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore
short-sighted</li><li>Not learning from what
we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of
time.</li><li>see
what is not mentioned in the text</li><li>real thinking
requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing</li><li>A
common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out
the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought</li><li>Notes are only as valuable as
