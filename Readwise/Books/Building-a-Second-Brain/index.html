It‚Äôs time to acknowledge that we can‚Äôt ‚Äúuse our head‚Äù to store everything we need to know and to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines</li><li>Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.</li><li>This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas</li><li>your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case</li><li>For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a ‚Äúknowledge building block‚Äù‚Äîa discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.</li><li>The length and format don‚Äôt matter‚Äîif a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.<ul><li>Note: This is different from zettelkasten where a note is meant to be a concise unit of information</li></ul></li><li>So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom</li><li>Your brain is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful</li><li>This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can‚Äôt fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.</li><li>Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.</li><li>In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges.</li><li>Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.</li><li>Our careers and businesses depend more than ever on our ability to advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it as well.6
Advocating for a particular point of view isn‚Äôt just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material.</li><li>To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I‚Äôve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called ‚ÄúCODE‚Äù‚ÄîCapture; Organize; Distill; Express.</li><li>When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Don‚Äôt make it an analytical decision, and don‚Äôt worry about why exactly it resonates‚Äîjust look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it‚Äôs time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.</li><li>The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, ‚ÄúHow is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?‚Äù</li><li>Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic.</li><li>There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence.</li><li>Every time you take a note, ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?‚Äù That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.</li><li>Information becomes knowledge‚Äîpersonal, embodied, verified‚Äîonly when we put it to use.</li><li>This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating</li><li>Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others‚Äîby inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.</li><li>Creativity depends on a creative process.</li><li>Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts</li><li>Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner‚Äôs Approach to Capturing</li><li>It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you</li><li>You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.</li><li>The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital notes is saving too much.</li><li>The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.II</li><li>Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.</li><li>As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you‚Äôre taking in. This special feeling of ‚Äúresonance‚Äù‚Äîlike an echo in your soul‚Äîis your intuition telling you that something is literally ‚Äúnoteworthy.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to figure out exactly why it resonates. Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may skip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly slow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it‚Äôs time to hit ‚Äúsave.‚Äù</li><li>It‚Äôs a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note</li><li>Twyla Tharp‚Äôs box reveals the true value of a simple container: it is easy to use, easy to understand, easy to create, and easy to maintain</li><li>We don‚Äôt need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works</li><li>the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example‚Äîthink of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven‚Äîwe tend to think in more abstract ways. When we‚Äôre in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we‚Äôre more likely to think concretely.</li><li>Your Second Brain isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they don‚Äôt happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. It‚Äôs time for us to put more intention into the digital environments where we now spend so many of our waking hours</li><li>Once you‚Äôve created this environment, you‚Äôll know where to go when it‚Äôs time to execute or create. You won‚Äôt have to sit down and spend half an hour painstakingly gathering together all the materials you need to get started. Your Second Brain is like a mind cathedral that you can step into any time you want to shut out the world and imagine a world of your own.</li><li>As you begin to capture your ideas in a consistent way, you‚Äôre likely to experience a new sense of excitement about the information flowing all around you.
You‚Äôll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you have, and the interviews you listen to, knowing that any interesting idea you encounter can be reliably saved and utilized</li><li>Soon, however, you‚Äôll run head on into a new problem: what to do with all this valuable material you‚Äôve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger this problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and retrieve them only leads to more overwhelm.</li><li>libraries. I tried organizing my files by date, by subject, by kind, and countless other elaborate schemes, but every method I tried soon failed.
The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away from my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and obsolete</li><li>eventually named this organizing system PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.II</li><li>it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.</li><li>The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: ‚ÄúIn which project will this be most useful?‚Äù It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.</li><li>dedicated places for each of the main ‚Äúareas‚Äù of your life</li><li>resources,‚Äù which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration</li><li>archives‚Äù to keep them out of sight but within easy reach.</li><li>Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you‚Äôre working on now.
Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.</li><li>Knowing which projects you‚Äôre currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren‚Äôt important.</li><li>This is why it‚Äôs so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: ‚Äúkeeping what resonates‚Äù in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term</li><li>This points to a paradox that a lot of people experience as they take notes: the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, the more time and effort it takes to review it all, and the less time they have to do so</li><li>Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you‚Äôve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project</li><li>The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several ‚Äúlayers.‚Äù Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart</li><li>This is what I call ‚Äúlayer one‚Äù‚Äîthe chunks of text initially captured in my notes</li><li>To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation</li><li>All I have to do is bold the main points within the note</li><li>For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting</li><li>There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I‚Äôll add an ‚Äúexecutive summary‚Äù at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words</li><li>recommend using bullet points</li><li>Use your own words,</li><li>With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain</li><li>This is actually a great way to filter down the volume of notes you‚Äôre taking‚Äîthe best stuff always sticks in your mind for an hour or two</li><li>The result points to a mysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so simple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort that was needed to get there</li><li>One of Pablo Picasso‚Äôs most famous drawings, created in 1945 and known as Picasso‚Äôs Bull, offers a master class in how distillation works</li><li>Ken Burns, the renowned creator of award-winning films like The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz, has said that only a tiny percentage of the raw footage he captures eventually makes it into the final cut</li><li>for every forty to fifty hours of footage he captures, only one hour makes it into the final film</li><li>You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without leaving some points out. You cannot make a highlight reel of a video without cutting some of the footage. You cannot give an effective presentation without leaving out some slides.</li><li>A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10‚Äì20 percent of the previous layer</li><li>When should I be doing this highlighting?‚Äù The answer is that you should do it when you‚Äôre getting ready to create something.</li><li>every time you ‚Äútouch‚Äù a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII</li><li>If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences</li><li>As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.</li><li>The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.</li><li>The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know</li><li>that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity</li><li>Our creativity thrives on examples.
