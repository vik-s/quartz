Bill Gates happened to be one of them.</li><li>Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.</li><li>The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.</li><li>We all do crazy stuff with money, because we‚Äôre all relatively new to this game and what looks crazy to you might make sense to me. But no one is crazy‚Äîwe all make decisions based on our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment.</li><li>Years ago I asked economist Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in economics, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to know about investing that we can‚Äôt know?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe exact role of luck in successful outcomes,‚Äù he answered.</li><li>But since it‚Äôs hard to quantify luck and rude to suggest people‚Äôs success is owed to it, the default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a factor of success.</li><li>Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.</li><li>realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.</li><li>focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.</li><li>people who have control over their time tend to be happier in life is a broad and common enough observation that you can do something with it.</li><li>The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won‚Äôt wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.</li><li>But more important is that as much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures.</li><li>Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, ‚ÄúYes, but I have something he will never have ‚Ä¶ enough.‚Äù</li><li>There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt need.</li><li>The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.</li><li>Social comparison is the problem here</li><li>It gets dangerous when the taste of having more‚Äîmore money, more power, more prestige‚Äîincreases ambition faster than satisfaction.</li><li>The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it‚Äôs a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with‚Äîto accept that you might have enough, even if it‚Äôs less than those around you.</li><li>‚ÄúEnough‚Äù is not too little.</li><li>There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.</li><li>The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference.</li><li>More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I‚Äôm unbreakable I actually think I‚Äôll get the biggest returns, because I‚Äôll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.</li><li>Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.</li><li>A barbelled personality‚Äîoptimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future‚Äîis vital.</li><li>Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.</li><li>A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.</li><li>The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, ‚ÄúI can do whatever I want today.‚Äù</li><li>The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.</li><li>Money‚Äôs greatest intrinsic value‚Äîand this can‚Äôt be overstated‚Äîis its ability to give you control over your time.</li><li>The most powerful common denominator of happiness was simple. Campbell summed it up:</li><li>Having a strong sense of controlling one‚Äôs life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.</li><li>Using</li><li>your money to buy time and options has a lifestyle benefit few luxury goods can compete with.</li><li>But doing something you love on a schedule you can‚Äôt control can feel the same as doing something you hate.</li><li>There is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it reactance</li><li>No one‚Äînot a single person out of a thousand‚Äîsaid that to be happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want.</li><li>No one‚Äînot a single person‚Äîsaid it‚Äôs important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they do it‚Äôs real success.</li><li>No one‚Äînot a single person‚Äîsaid you should choose your work based on your desired future earning power.</li><li>What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. ‚ÄúYour kids don‚Äôt want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,‚Äù Pillemer writes.</li><li>Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.</li><li>the truth is that wealth is what you don‚Äôt see.</li><li>More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.</li><li>A question you should ask as the range of your competition expands is, ‚ÄúHow do I stand out?‚Äù</li><li>In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills‚Äîlike communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility.</li><li>Richard Feynman, the great physicist, once said, ‚ÄúImagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.‚Äù</li><li>The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‚ÄòThe four most dangerous words in investing are, ‚Äòit‚Äôs different this time.‚Äô‚Äù</li><li>The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‚Äòit‚Äôs different this time.‚Äô‚Äù</li><li>History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas</li><li>the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary</li><li>Having a gap between what you can technically endure versus what‚Äôs emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error.</li><li>Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science</li><li>assume the future returns I‚Äôll earn in my lifetime will be ‚Öì lower than the historic average</li><li>Leverage is the devil here. Leverage‚Äîtaking on debt to make your money go further‚Äîpushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin.</li><li>You have to survive to succeed</li><li>The ability to do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want, has an infinite ROI.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://notes.vsekar.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Vikram Sekar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://notes.vsekar.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vikramskr>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vik-s>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
