These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</li><li>Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</li><li>Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work</li><li>Learning something complex like computer programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration on cognitively demanding concepts</li><li>To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work</li><li>To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.</li><li>But as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our population are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key currency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality.</li><li>The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.</li><li>Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.</li><li>More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people’s daily lives. I’m comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding skill</li><li>A deep life is a good life.</li><li>It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world’s best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time</li><li>to complete the project at hand. In this scenario, you’ll probably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can service many more clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off.</li><li>talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There’s a premium to being the best</li><li>In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.</li><li>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy<ol><li>The ability to quickly master hard things.</li><li>The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.</li></ol></li><li>This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary for working well with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar in just about any field</li><li>If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient.

Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused</li><li>tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive</li><li>Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused attention required by deliberate practice</li><li>neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks</li><li>scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner</li><li>To be great at something is to be well myelinated.</li><li>By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation</li><li>This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.</li><li>To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction</li><li>Give and Take<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches</li><li>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)</li><li>Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.</li><li>the attention residue concept is still telling because it implies that the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance</li><li>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work</li><li>To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable.<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">pink</a></li><li>Note: Really? What about bill gates going to his cabin and coming up with a memo about the internet? Such generalizations dont work. Its easier to say, deep work doesnt guarantee greatness, or shallow work doesnt guarantee that youre a failure,
Edit: he does say this later</li></ul></li><li>Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare</li><li>big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work</li><li>as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts</li><li>None of these behaviors would survive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world.</li><li>The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the</li><li>bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.</li><li>To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier. There are at least two big reasons why this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your needs. If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment</li><li>The second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox</li><li>all the while feeling satisfyingly productive</li><li>name another example, consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier. For many, these standing meetings become a simple (but blunt) form of personal organization. Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them</li><li>to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible simulacrum of progress</li><li>The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. By doing so, this principle drives us toward shallow work in an economy that increasingly rewards depth.</li><li>I’m actively irresponsible.</li><li>A similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers. They want to prove that they’re productive members of the team and are earning their keep, but they’re not entirely clear what this goal constitutes</li><li>Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value</li><li>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</li><li>Postman argued that our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.</li><li>In Morozov’s critique, we’ve made “the Internet” synonymous with the revolutionary future of business and government.</li><li>The alternative, to not embrace all things Internet, is, as Postman would say, “invisible and therefore irrelevant.”</li><li>Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological</li><li>If you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in general, as it’s leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value production. But for you, as an individual, good news lurks. The myopia of your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage.</li><li>depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable</li><li>The goal of this chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much satisfaction in an information economy as it so clearly does in a craft economy. In the sections ahead, I’ll make three arguments to support this claim. These arguments roughly follow a trajectory from the conceptually narrow to broad: starting with a neurological perspective, moving to the psychological, and ending with the philosophical.</li><li>The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.</li><li>what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore—plays in defining the quality of our life</li><li>Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to</li><li>Rapt<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.</li><li>Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.</li><li>Many knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting with these types of shallow concerns</li><li>this is a foolhardy way to go about your day, as it ensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your working life that’s dominated by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality.</li><li>when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right</li><li>In work (and especially knowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life</li><li>I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience sampling method (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually feel about the beats of our daily lives.</li><li>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.

This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else</li><li>This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).</li><li>The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day</li><li>To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.</li><li>the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits</li><li>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to implementing this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work require a flexibility that many fear they lack in their current positions.</li><li>people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are well defined and well advertised, and outside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find.</li><li>the rhythmic philosophy.

It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.</li><li>The decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your self-control in such scheduling matters</li><li>it’s not just self-control issues that bias them toward the rhythmic philosophy, but also the reality that some jobs don’t allow you to disappear for days at a time when the need to go deep arises</li><li>This is likely the biggest reason why the rhythmic philosophy is one of the most common among deep workers in standard office jobs.</li><li>Isaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book</li><li>I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy</li><li>This approach is not for the deep work novice</li><li>Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves</li><li>This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities—a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed.

You could, for example, use Kreider’s approach of retreating from the world of shallow tasks altogether by hiding out in an “undisclosed location,” but this isn’t practical for most people. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely</li><li>A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.</li><li>attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate</li><li>To concentrate requires what ART calls directed attention.

If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday</li><li>Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career</li><li>To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention</li><li>Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed</li><li>In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.</li><li>The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect</li><li>This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention</li><li>The shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the Zeigarnik effect. While it doesn’t force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in your task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force you to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day. This ritual ensures that no task will be forgotten: Each will be reviewed daily and tackled when the time is appropriate. Your mind, in other words, is released from its duty to keep track of these obligations at every moment—your shutdown ritual has taken over that responsibility.</li><li>Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done</li><li>The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained</li><li>Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction</li><li>If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.</li><li>The strategies that follow are motivated by the key idea that getting the most out of your deep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction</li><li>I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction</li><li>Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the next time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.</li><li>The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.</li><li>The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.
One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when you’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It’s crucial in these situations that if you’re in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable</li><li>To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy proposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy.</li><li>identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline—for example, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect it. If this isn’t possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by setting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid seeing it as you work.
At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity</li><li>always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility</li><li>Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable</li><li>Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve—providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain.</li><li>The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.</li><li>I suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own life. You don’t necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal should be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical week. Fortunately, finding time for this strategy is easy, as it takes advantage of periods that would otherwise be wasted (such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work</li><li>When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back</li><li>When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it</li><li>When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step.</li><li>In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process</li><li>review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory</li><li>define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables</li><li>the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified</li><li>This cycle of reviewing and storing variables, identifying and tackling the next-step question, then consolidating your gains is like an intense workout routine for your concentration ability</li><li>Moonwalking with Einstein<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">green</a></li></ul></li><li>idea that a drastic Internet sabbatical* is the only alternative to the distraction generated by social media and infotainment has increasingly pervaded our cultural conversation.</li><li>The problem with this binary response to this issue is that these two choices are much too crude to be useful.</li><li>Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them.

By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule.
