Maybe even turn it into opportunity?</li><li>a hidden source of anguish that wasn’t just widespread but nearly universal among people who have done well in their careers</li><li>came to call this the “striver’s curse”: people who strive to be excellent at what they do often wind up finding their inevitable decline terrifying, their successes increasingly unsatisfying, and their relationships lacking.</li><li>called “Stein’s law,” named after the famous economist Herbert Stein from the 1970s: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”</li><li>Here is the reality: in practically every high-skill profession, decline sets in sometime between one’s late thirties and early fifties. Sorry, I know that stings. And it gets worse: the more accomplished one is at the peak of one’s career, the more pronounced decline seems once it has set in.</li><li>Among people in professions requiring ideas and intellect rather than athletic skill and significant physical strength, almost no one admits expecting decline before their seventies;</li><li>the most common age for great discovery is one’s late thirties.</li><li>Still, since 1985, the peak age is not old: for physicists, fifty; for chemistry, forty-six; and for medicine, forty-five. After that, innovation drops precipitously.</li><li>For writers, decline sets in between about forty and fifty-five</li><li>Financial professionals reach peak performance between the ages of thirty-six and forty</li><li>Or take doctors: they appear to peak in their thirties, with steep drop-offs in skill as the years pass</li><li>The researchers found that physicians over sixty-five are 50 percent more likely than younger doctors (under fifty-one) at being found at fault for malpractice.</li><li>average age of the founders of the highest-growth start-ups is, in fact, forty-five</li><li>the peak of creative careers occurs at about twenty years after career inception,</li><li>hence the finding that people usually start declining somewhere between thirty-five and fifty</li><li>half-life” of many professions—the age at which half of one’s work has been produced</li><li>In middle age, the prefrontal cortex degrades in effectiveness, and this has several implications</li><li>The first is that rapid analysis and creative innovation will suffer</li><li>The second is that some specific, once-easy skills become devilishly hard, like multitasking.</li><li>I have no doubt that what made decline so hard for Pauling was that as his abilities declined, so did his relevance to the public<ul><li>Note: There is a distinct -difference between how Dirac aged as Compared to Linus Pauling. Dirac admitted his best work was done by age 30. Pauling refused to admit it. He tried to prolong his relevance by getting into hoax science. He believed in eugenics and Tod told people that those with sickle-cell disease should not be allowed to procreate
Pauling became a great believed in the importance of vitamins for human existence. He believed in taking an excess of vitamins to prolong health. He called this orthomolecular psychiatry. He eventually came to be known as a quack in mainstream medical circles</li></ul></li><li>the “principle of psychoprofessional gravitation”: the idea that the agony of decline is directly related to prestige previously achieved, and to one’s emotional attachment to that prestige.</li><li>studies show that people who have chased power and achievement in their professional lives tend to be unhappier after retirement than people who did not</li><li>The fact that we can’t store up our glories and enjoy them when they are long past gets to the problem of dissatisfaction</li><li>No one feels sorry for a successful person.</li><li>Two intelligences</li><li>In 1971, Cattell published a book entitled Abilities: Their Structure, Growth, and Action. In it, he posited that there were two types of intelligence</li><li>defined as the ability to reason, think flexibly, and solve novel problems</li><li>there is also crystallized intelligence. This is defined as the ability to use a stock of knowledge learned in the past</li><li>When you are young, you can generate lots of facts; when you are old, you know what they mean and how to use them.</li><li>It says that if your career relies solely on fluid intelligence, it’s true that you will peak and decline pretty early.</li><li>But if your career requires crystallized intelligence—or if you can repurpose your professional life to rely more on crystallized intelligence—your peak will come later but your decline will happen much, much later, if ever. And if you can go from one type to the other—well, then you have cracked the code.</li><li>However, there always exists the ability to redesign your career less on innovation and more on instruction as the years pass, thus playing to your strengths with age.</li><li>Notably, there is teaching, which once again requires verbal skill and a gift for explaining large amounts of accumulated information.</li><li>The idea of moving to instruction later in life is a theme one finds in the great wisdom literatures from East to West. “Just as one uses a burning candle to light others with,” says the elderly archery teacher in Eugen Herrigel’s famous book Zen in the Art of Archery, “so the teacher transfers the spirit of the right art from heart to heart, that it may be illumined.”</li><li>Cicero believed three things about older age. First, that it should be dedicated to service, not goofing off. Second, our greatest gift later in life is wisdom, in which learning and thought create a worldview that can enrich others. Third, our natural ability at this point is counsel: mentoring, advising, and teaching others, in a way that does not amass worldly rewards of money, power, or prestige.</li><li>Or consider the wisdom of the first-century BC Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero.</li><li>Cicero was assassinated at the age of sixty-three for his less than politically correct ideas (specifically, his criticism of Mark Antony after the murder of Julius Caesar). Running for his life due to his political views, he</li><li>was captured by a Roman centurion and was about to be put to death. The pinnacle of crystallized intelligence, he was a teacher with his dying breath. “There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier,” Cicero schooled the centurion. “But do try to kill me properly.”[11]</li><li>If you’re experiencing decline in fluid intelligence</li><li>It means it is time to jump off the fluid intelligence curve and onto the crystallized intelligence curve</li><li>Those who fight against time are trying to bend the old curve instead of getting onto the new one</li><li>So why do people try, over and over again? Two reasons: First, they are not aware that their first curve naturally bends down—they think something is wrong with them. And second, they don’t know that another curve exists that will take them to a new kind of success.</li><li>it can be hard and scary to make the jump. It requires the courage and fortitude to make changes in our lives and careers—to become more of a teacher, whatever that means in one’s specific field. Not everybody wants to do that. Many</li><li>But for those who make the jump, the reward is almost always enormous</li><li>He spent the last ten years of his life working on, among other projects, Die Kunst der Fuge—The Art of Fugue—a collection of fugues and canons based on a single theme intended to teach the compositional techniques of the baroque.</li><li>J.</li><li>S. Bach could easily have become embittered like Darwin, feeling left behind by the musical cognoscenti after a career at the forefront. Instead, he took pride in his son’s originality and redesigned his own life, moving from musical innovator to master teacher.</li><li>Far from frustration and depression, he finished out his life as a happy father and reinvented himself as a teacher.</li><li>when Bach saw the back half of his fluid intelligence curve, he jumped with both feet onto his crystallized intelligence curve and never looked back.</li><li>Devote the back half of your life to serving others with your wisdom. Get old sharing the things you believe are most important.</li><li>Maybe I would prefer to be special rather than happy.</li><li>cared more about being high than being happy</li><li>Something is clearly wrong when the idea of being “normal” induces enough panic to make someone neglect the people they love in favor of the possible admiration of strangers.</li><li>In the 1980s, physician Robert Goldman famously found in his research that half of aspiring athletes would be willing to accept certain death in five years in exchange for an Olympic gold medal today.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://notes.vsekar.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Vikram Sekar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://notes.vsekar.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vikramskr>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vik-s>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
