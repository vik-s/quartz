And it took me 4 months to write my 2nd book.
Now, I can write a 60,000 word book in 30 days.
Here&rsquo;s the framework:
<strong>1. Your book&rsquo;s Main Title/Subtitle is 80% of the work.</strong>
• What question (of the reader&rsquo;s) are you answering?
• What problem are you solving?
• What solution are you unlocking?
• How are you going to get there?
Don&rsquo;t start writing till you can answer these 4 questions.
<strong>2. Make a list of all the Main Points you want to make in your book.</strong>
Again, don&rsquo;t start writing yet.
List out:
• The big ideas that matter most
• And decide in what order
If you can do this, with clarity, your book is 90% done.
<strong>3. Under each Main Point, list out all the little sub-points.</strong>
Again, don&rsquo;t start writing yet.
Keep listing:
• What smaller ideas do you want to include?
• What examples?
• What insights?
• What stories?
Do this, and your book is 95% done.
<strong>4. Now just go down your list of Main Points, section by section.</strong>
All your sub-points are your &ldquo;notes&rdquo; of what to write about.
This makes the writing 100x easier.
Because you literally have the words right in front of you.
&ldquo;Say this here.&rdquo;
Now you&rsquo;re 99% done.
<strong>5. Do a final spelling/grammar read through.</strong>
Since you took the time to organize all your thoughts FIRST, by the time you &ldquo;finish writing,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re done.
Give your book a once-over for spelling/grammar.
And you&rsquo;re 100% done. (
<a href=https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1714975200075284737 rel=noopener>View Tweet</a>)</li><li><strong>99% of successful individuals start doing these 9 things early in life:</strong>
People define success in a lot of different ways.
Some think it’s a certain amount of money.
Others define it as a way of living, a level of freedom.
The truth is, you can define success a hundred different ways — the only thing that matters is whether or not you’ve met the expectation you have for yourself.
If you ask most people what they want out of life, however, almost everyone will say, in some way, that they want to be “successful.”
They want the big promotion, the fancy car, the house on the hill, the powerful network, the list goes on.
Unfortunately, because “success” is a subjective aim, very few people have any sort of actionable plan or even idea as to how they’re going to achieve the success they want so badly.
They believe, if they say or think about it enough, success will just “happen.”
Except it doesn’t work like that.
Here are the things you should start doing in your 20s to guarantee you’ll be successful — no matter what.
The sooner you get started, the better.
<strong>1. Start working on your emotional health, now.</strong>
Life only gets busier.
Too often, people say the phrase, “I will once I’m a bit further along.”
But then they get a bit further along, and nothing changes.
They just keep saying, “I’ll do it when I’m older. Later, when I have more time.”
But this is a dangerous cycle.
Take 5 or 10 minutes, per day, and start practicing the habit of working on your emotional health now.
<strong>2. Spend time with people who aren’t in their 20s.</strong>
You don’t learn as much spending time around people who are exactly where you are.
You learn by surrounding yourself with people who are further along, who have been where you are and have moved to the next level.
If you’re in your 20s, then you want to spend time with people in their late 30s, 40s, 50s and above.
They’re the ones with the answers — not your friend who is 25 and still trying to figure things out for him or herself.
<strong>3. Save and invest as much money as you possibly can.</strong>
Investments benefit most from the variable of time.
The sooner you can get started saving and investing, the more dramatic your gains will be over the long term.
Business Insider published a great piece on this about how much more money you’d have for retirement if you started saving when you were 25 as opposed to 35.
The difference is massive.
Second, financial freedom doesn’t come from buying new sneakers or mimosas during brunch.
Financial freedom starts to happen when money becomes a tool for you to use to make more money.
It has to work for you — not the other way around.
And the sooner you start practicing that skill, the faster you’ll get to a place where you’re financially secure.
<strong>4. Get rid of friends who aren’t going anywhere in life.</strong>
This might sound harsh, but it’s true: you are a direct reflection of the people around you.
At a certain point, it’s important to realize where people are headed in life, and how much time you want to continue investing in those relationships.
You don’t have to be mean about it, or stop talking to long-time friends entirely.
But you also shouldn’t keep spending two nights per week getting beers with your buddy who is entirely comfortable in his cubicle job — if that’s not the sort of life you want for yourself.
Friendships are investments.
Invest wisely.
<strong>5. Keep reading (even though you’re out of school).</strong>
So many people stop reading in their 20s.
We live in the age of Netflix shows and podcasts, YouTube series’ and TikTok.
But the truth is, reading is a completely different experience.
It slows you down.
It forces you to think deeply.
It’s also one of the only forms of knowledge transfer that allows us to receive insights from those who came decades, even centuries, before us.
The smartest people read — and you should too.
<strong>6. Find a workout regime that supplements your primary aim in life.</strong>
Success is almost always rooted in some form of physical exercise.
Even the chess titan, Bobby Fischer, swore by his exercise routine to stay in shape and focused for upcoming matches.
When we’re young, we tend to only associate physical exercise with “sports.”
But as we get older, physical exercise becomes one of the few ways we can maintain a relationship with ourselves — our gym time is our personal time; an early-morning run clears your head for the day.
Instead of only associating exercise with “getting fit,” think of it as a routine to make you better in all aspects of your life.
<strong>7. Don’t let your hobbies die.</strong>
We all have things we love to do purely for fun.
Unfortunately, they tend to fall to the wayside as life continues to take its course.
Our hobbies become reprioritized. Our careers take over.
Add in a family, kids, bills, vacations, etc., and next thing you know, it has been ten years since you picked up the guitar or wrote in your journal.
But our hobbies are what keep us grounded.
They help us remember not to take life too seriously, and to always make time to enjoy the journey.
<strong>8. Find a mentor — and forgo short-term rewards for knowledge that will last a lifetime.</strong>
Everyone in their 20s is so obsessed with becoming successful as soon as possible.
And while this sort of hunger to succeed is great, it should never cause you to make short-sighted decisions.
For example, what’s more valuable:
Pitching your services for $1,000 but being treated as a vendor?
Or performing your service for free but getting to work directly with the person you want to learn from the most?
A lot of people would disagree with this sort of mentality, and yet it’s one of the greatest “success” shortcuts on the planet.
The more you can give up short-term rewards, and invest in yourself, the slower things might be in the beginning but the higher your ceiling will ultimately become.
<strong>9. Nurture your relationship with your significant other.</strong>
I used to think you could only become successful (in your 20s) if you were 100% dedicated, obsessed with making progress, and, well, single.
There are a lot of entrepreneurs, especially, who live by this sort of mentality — and even the ones that do have relationships will regularly de-prioritize their partner. And even their partner will eventually say, “He always says he has to work, and there’s no time for me.”
But this is a flawed approach in both business and life.
I’ve come to learn (through my own relationship) that having someone to share the journey with, to emotionally support you along the way, isn’t going to hold you back.
If anything, a life partner will make you better — which means it’s your responsibility to help nurture that relationship along the way. (

On any given day, I write somewhere in the ballpark of 10,000 words—and the genres are all over the board.
• I write here on X
• I write newsletters
• I work on my fiction project
• I write new assets for <a href=https://twitter.com/ship30for30>@ship30for30</a>, PGA, PGM, & <a href=https://twitter.com/typeshare_co>@typeshare_co</a>
• I spend hours working on my next non-fiction book
• And I have a journal for poetry and quick ideas that I keep with me at all times
<strong>When I tell people how much I write, they can’t comprehend it.</strong>
Most struggle to write a single blog post in a week—for me, that’s a warm-up with my morning breakfast.
However, as a writer, I have learned that the art of being able to consistently write well is not just about the output. Writing well has far more to do with input, and what information you are feeding yourself.
So, if you ever find yourself stuck, unsure of what to write about—whether it’s a personal project, a company blog, or even a social media post—then I encourage you to ask yourself these seven questions:
<strong>1. What do I really want to say?</strong>
This is where it all begins.
Oftentimes, people make writing far more complicated than it needs to be. Step away from your computer for a moment, go stand in your kitchen, and ask yourself aloud, “Okay, what do I really want to say?”
Chances are, you’ll be able to say it in a single sentence.
Start there.
<strong>2. Who is sitting in the audience?</strong>
When you know who you’re speaking to, it becomes infinitely easier to write with purpose and conviction.
This is something I learned through writing on Quora, where you are literally writing directly to the person who asked a question. By reading the question, you have an idea of who would be asking that in the first place — which gives you an audience.
Don’t write to the open air. Ask yourself who is sitting in the audience.
<strong>3. What part of you is speaking?</strong>
There is a writing proverb I love that says, “A novel is only as good as the novelist who knows himself.”
Most people lack direction in their writing because they aren’t sure which “part” of them is speaking. This is the art of voice and tone, and it really does come down to knowing the emotion you want to write from.
If you’re stuck, chances are it’s because you don’t know which part of you wants to tell the story or voice the information.
So ask yourself: “Who is talking right now?”
<strong>4. What emotion do you want the reader to feel?</strong>
Writing is about being aware of two opposite forces at the same time: how you feel, and how you want your audience to feel.
It’s this second part that a lot of writers (and even, more generally, content creators) forget. They ramble, or they rant, or they write and write without thinking about whether what they’re producing is actually achieving the goal they want—to make their audience feel a certain way.
Imagine if you were in the audience for a second.
What would you want to hear?
<strong>5. What’s the intention?</strong>
Anything that is created from scratch has an intention.
The question is whether you, as the creator, are aware of that intention.
The truth is, you should be. The more you can get clear, not necessarily on what you want to create, but why you’re creating it, the more easily the work will unfold on its own.
Without a clear intention, however, the work will remain aimless. So ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing, and then create from there.
<strong>6. Is it timely and timeless?</strong>
I give a mentor of mine credit for this one, always urging me to create things that are both timely and relevant, but also timeless.
As often as possible, you want to ask yourself what would make an impact now, in the world we live in today, and what would still be considered worthwhile 50 years from now.
By asking yourself if what you’re creating is both timely and timeless, you will inherently start to weed out a lot of the bad ideas — or, you will push yourself to turn a decent idea into a great one.
Play both the long and the short game.
<strong>7. Who thinks this is a bad idea?</strong>
Whenever I hesitate to write something, I try to ask myself why I am hesitating. What is that fear, and why is it there?
Most of the time, the fear stems from a type of person (archetypal or someone specific in our lives) who we feel would not respond well to whatever it is we are feeling urged to write.
So, who is that person? And why do you think they would disapprove of whatever it is you are creating?
In a sense, by being able to clearly imagine that person, you can now see them in your audience. And by having them in your audience, you now have the conscious choice of how you want to speak to them.
All this goes back to the other questions above. The more aware you are of the different variables, the easier it is to acknowledge them and then deliberately create.<img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEIva6qXwAAbF9I.jpg> (
