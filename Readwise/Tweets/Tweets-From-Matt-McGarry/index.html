Newsletters can scale to millions in sales with small teams.
Here are some examples:
<strong>1) TLDR Newsletter</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$5-$10M
Newsletter subscribers: 1,250,000
Monetization type: Sponsors
Growth method: Paid ads
Team size: ~4 full-time
Their Q1 2023 rate card said their primary sponsor slot was $18,000.
Assuming they sell all of those ad units but no others, they’re doing $4,680,000 in yearly ad revenue.
Real revenue is likely much higher though (they now have 300k+ more subscribers).
LinkedIn says their team is just 4 employees, most of them joining recently.
<strong>2) Lenny’s Newsletter</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$2-$3M
Newsletter subscribers: 540,000+
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Twitter and Substack Recommendations
Team size: 1
Lenny’s newsletter primarily makes money with paid subscriptions.
Over 18,000 people pay to get every issue of the newsletter plus access to his private community.
Lenny is the go-to expert on product-led growth, and thousands of tech companies are happy to pay for his insights which can’t be found anywhere else.
<strong>3) Justin Welsh</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1.5M-$2.5M
Newsletter subscribers: 180,000+
Monetization type: Courses, Sponsorships
Growth method: LinkedIn, Twitter
Team size: 1
Justin is a master of social growth. He uses his social following to grow his free newsletter and drive customers to his course.
Justin also sells newsletter sponsorships and previously offered paid consulting calls.
Over 23,000 people have bought his courses — which cost $150 each — translating to $3,450,000 in course sales alone.
<strong>4) The Van Trump Report</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$20M
Newsletter subscribers: 30,000-40,000 (paid)
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Direct traffic, network, word of mouth
Team size: 1
This is the go-to newsletter for the agricultural industry. It’s a daily newsletter agricultural professionals and investors use to make more informed decisions.
<strong>5) Stratechery</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$3-5M
Newsletter subscribers: 26,000+ (paid)
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Direct traffic, SEO, word of mouth
Team size: 1
Stratechery is a daily newsletter and podcast analyzing the tech industry.
It’s estimated to have over 26,000 paid subscribers at $12/month or $120/year — translating to >$3M in annual revenue.
That estimate is 2+ years old, so that figure is likely much higher now.
<strong>6) Superhuman AI</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1M-$2M
Newsletter subscribers: 500,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, LinkedIn, SparkLoop, Paid Social
Team size: 2
This newsletter skyrocketed to 500,000+ subscribers this year.
It’s monetized through sponsorships. If they sell all of their sponsor slots, they’d make $5,997 per send — over $1.5M per year.
<strong>7) The Generalist</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1.5M-$3M
Newsletter subscribers: 100,000
Monetization type: Paid newsletter and community, Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, collaborations, Substack Recommendations
Team size: 2
The Generalist is a newsletter that analyzes tech and VC.
The 100,000+ subscribers are monetized with a paid subscription and newsletter sponsorships.
If 5% of subscribers convert to the $220/year subscription, that’s $1.1M in ARR.
Sponsorship revenue is harder to estimate. But it’s lucrative. The Generalist has a huge audience of founders and VCs with high net worths.
<strong>8) Marketing Examined</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1-$2M
Newsletter subscribers: 100,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, Meta ads
Team size: 1
This marketing newsletter did $100k in ad sales back in February of 2023.
They announced they plan to hit $2M ARR this year.
<strong>9) Marketing Examples</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$600k-$1M
Newsletter subscribers: 120,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships, coaching, courses
Growth method: Content distribution, Twitter, word of mouth
Team size: 1
Marketing Examples is a marketing and copywriting newsletter founded by Harry Dry.
He sells ads in his newsletter and website. If all inventory is sold these placements will result in $450k per year in ad sales.
Harry also offers 1on1 coaching for $900 — if he sells 3 calls per week, that’s an extra $140K in annual revenue.
Plus, Harry has a course he’s sold in the past. Course revenue can likely surpass ad and coaching revenue when it is live.
<strong>10) UI Dev</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$2M-$4M
Newsletter subscribers: 225,000+
Monetization type: Courses, Sponsorships
Growth method: Word of mouth, SEO, YouTube, Paid ads
Team size: 4
UI Dev is a media and education company for front-end developers.
They have 225k newsletter subscribers and 80k course customers.
They have 8 courses that are $149 each. Customers can buy those or get access to all courses plus more content for $495 per year.
For sponsorships, we can assume a $50 CPM on opens.
At 170k subscribers, 2 sends per week, and a 45% open rate, that’s $397,800 in sponsorships revenue.
Then if 2% of newsletter subscribers buy their annual course subscription at $499/year, that’s $1,696,600 in ARR.</a></li><li><a href=#new-highlights-added-november-29-2023-at-1230-pm>New highlights added November 29, 2023 at 12:30 PM</a></li><li><a href=#new-highlights-added-january-5-2024-at-622-am>New highlights added January 5, 2024 at 6:22 AM</a></li></ol></nav></details></aside><a href=#tweets-from-matt-mcgarry><h1 id=tweets-from-matt-mcgarry><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tweets From Matt McGarry</h1></a><p><img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1372970972123381772/bOnuyg5t.jpg width=auto alt=rw-book-cover></p><a href=#metadata><h2 id=metadata><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Author: <a class="internal-link broken">@JMatthewMcGarry on Twitter</a></li><li>Full Title: Tweets From Matt McGarry</li><li>Category: #tweets</li><li>URL:

Here’s how I did it.
Plus what worked, what okay worked, and what failed:
<strong>The First 100 Subscribers</strong>
I got the first 100 by:<ul><li>Twitter and LinkedIn posts to my ~800 followers (drove 75 subscribers)</li><li>Added a CTA for my newsletter in my email signature (drove ~10 subscribers)</li><li>Asked close friends and clients to subscribe (drove ~15 subscribers)
After that, I needed to hone in on acquisition channels….
<strong>What Worked Great</strong>
<em><strong>Twitter - 4,219 subscribers, 65% open rate, 26% CTR</strong></em>
Writing 1 thread per week and posting every day has had the largest impact on my newsletter growth.
Also, optimizing my profile was key in converting views into subscribers.
Think of your profile as an ad for people to follow you and join your newsletter.
Work on improving every element of that “ad” — Your profile picture, header, description, location, etc.
Next, I turned to paid…
<em><strong>Twitter Ads - 2,314 subscribers, 60% open rate, 13% CTR</strong></em>
I’ve spent $6,231 on Twitter ads to acquire 2,314 subscribers at a $2.69 CPA (cost per subscriber)
I offset my ad investment with Sparkloop Upscribe and beehiiv boosts.
With these tools I’m able to earn ~$1 per subscriber, making my net CPA $1.69.
<strong>What Kinda Worked</strong>
<em><strong>Referral program - 339 subscribers, 49% open rate, 20% CTR</strong></em>
Users unlock a reward after referring 1 subscriber.
These can be great for more popular niches, but can be tough for niches with smaller overall interest.
<em><strong>Cross-promotions - 250 subscribers, 70% open rate, 30% CTR</strong></em>
These were hit or miss.
Some of mine generated 100+ subscribers, some generated under 10.
However, cross-promos have generated some of my highest-quality subscribers.
<em><strong>beehiiv boosts - 411 subscribers, 44% open rate, 8% CTR</strong></em>
Boosts are a great way to grow with paid ads if you don&rsquo;t have the time or skill for FB or Twitter ads.
They&rsquo;re mostly automated.
<strong>What Didn’t Work</strong>
<em><strong>Newsletter ads - ~150 subscribers, ~65% open rate</strong></em>
I bought 4 ads in other newsletters. 3 flopped, 1 worked well.
Small sample size, but not great results.
I&rsquo;ll test this again later using CPC deals and beehiiv&rsquo;s ad network.
<em><strong>Facebook ads - 100 subscribers, 25% open rate</strong></em>
I spent $589 on FB ads to acquire 100 subscribers at a $5.89 CPA (cost per subscriber).
FB ads are amazing but they didn’t work out well for me (yet).
My content is niche and I didn’t do much creative testing.
<strong>Here’s a breakdown of where all subscribers are from:</strong></li><li>Twitter organic: 4,219</li><li>Twitter ads: 2,921</li><li>Website direct: 1,333</li><li>Google organic: 548</li><li>Beehiiv boosts: 367</li><li>Referral: 346</li><li>Other: 2,617
Hope this helps!
I&rsquo;ll report back at 20k subscribers. (

When people are reading they&rsquo;re more likely to stick around (retention) and to share it (acquisition).
How do you measure and improve engagement?
Unfortunately, open rates are no longer the answer.
<strong>Here&rsquo;s what to use instead&mldr;</strong>
The engagement metrics you should track and prioritize (in order):<ol><li>CTR</li><li>Poll responses</li><li>Reply rate</li><li>Open rate
(Always use unique clicks, CTR, replies, and opens).
<strong>Why is open rate not #1?</strong>
Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) killed open rate.
To oversimplify it - MPP &ldquo;opens&rdquo; emails even if they&rsquo;re not opened. This makes open rate metrics unreliable.
And MMP is impacting <strong>55%+ of opens</strong>.
You should still track and consider open rates, but clicks are king now.
Think about it:
The only reliable way subscribers add value to your newsletter is by clicking a:</li></ol><ul><li>Sponsors link</li><li>Product link</li><li>Or any link (which improves your deliverability)
You have no idea if a person who opened actually read the newsletter&mldr;
Or if that open was automated by MPP.
So what should you do now?
<strong>Use more links and ask people to click them.</strong>
Here’s how:</li><li>Add more contextual links to other content/products (ideally your content).</li><li>Add more call-to-actions for your products/sponsors.</li><li>Include a curated link section in your newsletter.</li><li>Ask people to click a link to stay subscribed</li><li>Use polls
<strong>Use a poll in every newsletter send</strong>
I like this &ldquo;5 star, 3 star, 1 star&rdquo; format:
Aim for 80%+ 5-star reviews and more poll responses each send.
Hope this helps! (

• Paid newsletter

• Paid community
• Data subscription

But these are generally the best fit for media founders.
If you only use sponsors and affiliates you need to start selling a product/service asap.
If you&rsquo;re starting a newsletter, think about your product/service offer from day 1.
The best newsletters are distribution channels for a high LTV product &ndash; not just a place to sell ads. (

If you want to start a newsletter but don’t know what to write about – this is for you.
It&rsquo;s hard to pick a niche.
Most advice is dead wrong:
<em>“Write about what you’re passionate about.”</em>
Unfortunately, it’s not that simple…
You still need the ability and skill to monetize that passion.
And some niches are MUCH more lucrative than others:
<strong>The Formula For Picking a Niche</strong>
When picking a niche, ask these 4 questions:<ol><li>What are your passions and interests?</li><li>What unique experiences and skills do you have?</li><li>How can you monetize?</li><li>How lucrative is this niche/topic?
You want to pick a niche that:
– You’re genuinely interested in (so you can stick to it)
– You have experience in (so you can create insightful content)
– Has lucrative monetization opportunities (so you can build a successful business)
<strong>Which Niches Can Be Monetized Best?</strong>
Some newsletter niches can make much more money than others.
To understand why, you need to know how newsletters make money.
<strong>There are 2 primary ways newsletters scale to 7 figures:</strong></li><li>Sponsorships/ads - Promote a product - get paid for that promotion</li><li>Owned Products - Promote and sell your content, product, or service
Let’s break down sponsorships:
To build a newsletter that will be mostly monetized with sponsorships, you need to know WHO sponsors newsletters.
The <strong>biggest newsletter sponsors</strong> are almost all in these categories:</li><li>SaaS</li><li>B2B software</li><li>Personal finance/investing
(According to Who Sponsors Stuff, SponsorGap, and 40+ newsletters I’ve worked with).
If you want to build a sponsorship business, you need to build an audience these advertisers want to get in front of.</li></ol><ul><li>B2B software and SaaS companies want to reach decision-makers at companies.</li><li>Personal finance and investing companies want to reach high-net-worth investors.
Now, let’s talk about <strong>owned products</strong>…
How do you sell your own product or service to subscribers?
The most successful newsletters I’ve seen sell products that help people:</li></ul><ol><li>Make more money</li><li>Save more money
This could mean:</li></ol><ul><li>A subscription that gives stock tips and investment insights
(Examples: Motley Fool, Agora, Bankless)</li><li>Course or membership that helps you start and grow a business
(Examples: Justin Welsh, Ship 30 for 30, StarterStory, Trends)</li><li>Course or membership that helps you be better at your job and start/advance your career
(Examples: Lenny&rsquo;s Newsletter, The Pragmatic Engineer, Byte Byte Go, Reforge)
<strong>The 10+ Best Newsletter Niches</strong>
Here are the newsletter niches I would pick if starting today:</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Finance and investing</strong>
(Stocks, crypto, real estate, VC, PE, angel investing, personal finance)
This is a massive category with dozens of lucrative niches inside.
I would pick a hyper-niche within finance and investing to start with.
Like:</li></ol><ul><li>Small-cap stock investing and trading</li><li>Self-storage real estate investing</li><li>Investing in single-family homes</li><li>Personal finance for founders</li></ul><ol start=2><li><strong>Luxury</strong>
(Watches, cars, fashion, drinks, jewelry, etc)
Another massive niche with many great niches to pick from.
I would start a newsletter based on one item or category:
Wine
Yachts
Cigars
Bourbon
Watches
Sneakers
Sports cars
Every day carry
Women’s or men’s fashion</li><li>**B2B **
(HR, marketing, IT, healthcare, media, banking, etc.)
Industry Dive (a B2B media company with millions of newsletter subscribers) sold for $525 million in 2022.
This is one of the biggest acquisitions in media ever.
B2B newsletters are lucrative because if you build an audience of business owners and operators that have huge purchasing power, the sponsorship opportunities are massive.
B2B newsletters have the highest ad rates I’ve seen.
CPMs can be $100-$500 while most B2C newsletters sell ads in the $25-$40 CPM range.
Pick a B2B niche where the professionals working in that industry and job function buy stuff.
And the more stuff they buy, the better.
For example:
Marketers have big budgets to spend (part of their job is buying things to help their company grow).
On the other hand, customer support employees don’t have much buying power or decision-making ability on what they buy.
This is why there are dozens of marketing newsletters and very few newsletters about customer support.
<strong>Which B2B niche should you pick?</strong>
There are so many possibilities.
Industry Dive has 30+ publications ranging from agriculture to legal, to manufacturing, to cybersecurity, and many more.
WorkWeek covers marketing, media, healthcare, sales, and more.
All of MorningBrew’s new newsletter offerings have been B2B:
RetailBrew, MarketingBrew, HR Brew, IT Brew, CFO Brew, and Healthcare Brew.
If you want to start a B2B newsletter you should pick a niche that:
– You have deep experience in
– Has buying power and decision-making ability</li><li><strong>Sports betting and fantasy sports</strong>
I love this niche for 3 reasons:</li><li>The readers are super passionate</li><li>The opportunity to sell sponsorships to sportsbooks is huge</li><li>Readers are willing to pay for information to help them win more
There are already a few super successful newsletters in this niche:</li></ol><ul><li>FootballGuys has 600k+ free subscribers and tens of thousands of customers who pay for their subscriptions.</li><li>FasntasyLife has 400k+ free subscribers and recently raised $2M from investors.</li></ul><ol start=5><li><strong>Local news</strong>
Local newsletters are awesome.
Here’s why:
Most local news companies are old and outdated.
There’s room in the market for a new way to get local news.
And there are already people who have built 7-figure businesses with local newsletters:</li></ol><ul><li>OverStory Media Group has 14 local newsletters.</li><li>6AM City has 26 local newsletters.
Local newsletters are simple to write and grow.
They can scale to 6 figures in one town - and 7 and 8 figures when expanded into multiple towns.</li></ul><ol start=6><li><strong>Hyper-niche, hyper-passionate audiences</strong>
Here are 7 more niche ideas:
– “Rush Media” — Newsletter about fraternity/sorority news, culture, and events. There are 750k+ members and 9M+ alumni.
– Newsletter about religion (or a topic from a religious perspective). The Pour Over has 500k+ subscribers and covers daily news from a Christian perspective. This could be done from the perspective of another religion or on other topics.
– Newsletter for a fan base: Star Wars, Warhammer 40k, Star Trek, Soap Operas, Marvel, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering, etc.
– Newsletter about expensive hobbies: Reef keeping, motorcycling, fishing, hunting, camping, crochet, quilting, etc.
– Newsletter about collectibles: Sneakers, coins, trading cards, stamps, comics, dolls, antiques, vinyl records, etc.
– A newsletter about being a better dad or mom
