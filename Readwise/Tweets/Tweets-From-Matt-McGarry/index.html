Newsletters can scale to millions in sales with small teams.
Here are some examples:
<strong>1) TLDR Newsletter</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$5-$10M
Newsletter subscribers: 1,250,000
Monetization type: Sponsors
Growth method: Paid ads
Team size: ~4 full-time
Their Q1 2023 rate card said their primary sponsor slot was $18,000.
Assuming they sell all of those ad units but no others, they’re doing $4,680,000 in yearly ad revenue.
Real revenue is likely much higher though (they now have 300k+ more subscribers).
LinkedIn says their team is just 4 employees, most of them joining recently.
<strong>2) Lenny’s Newsletter</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$2-$3M
Newsletter subscribers: 540,000+
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Twitter and Substack Recommendations
Team size: 1
Lenny’s newsletter primarily makes money with paid subscriptions.
Over 18,000 people pay to get every issue of the newsletter plus access to his private community.
Lenny is the go-to expert on product-led growth, and thousands of tech companies are happy to pay for his insights which can’t be found anywhere else.
<strong>3) Justin Welsh</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1.5M-$2.5M
Newsletter subscribers: 180,000+
Monetization type: Courses, Sponsorships
Growth method: LinkedIn, Twitter
Team size: 1
Justin is a master of social growth. He uses his social following to grow his free newsletter and drive customers to his course.
Justin also sells newsletter sponsorships and previously offered paid consulting calls.
Over 23,000 people have bought his courses — which cost $150 each — translating to $3,450,000 in course sales alone.
<strong>4) The Van Trump Report</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$20M
Newsletter subscribers: 30,000-40,000 (paid)
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Direct traffic, network, word of mouth
Team size: 1
This is the go-to newsletter for the agricultural industry. It’s a daily newsletter agricultural professionals and investors use to make more informed decisions.
<strong>5) Stratechery</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$3-5M
Newsletter subscribers: 26,000+ (paid)
Monetization type: Paid Subscription
Growth method: Direct traffic, SEO, word of mouth
Team size: 1
Stratechery is a daily newsletter and podcast analyzing the tech industry.
It’s estimated to have over 26,000 paid subscribers at $12/month or $120/year — translating to >$3M in annual revenue.
That estimate is 2+ years old, so that figure is likely much higher now.
<strong>6) Superhuman AI</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1M-$2M
Newsletter subscribers: 500,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, LinkedIn, SparkLoop, Paid Social
Team size: 2
This newsletter skyrocketed to 500,000+ subscribers this year.
It’s monetized through sponsorships. If they sell all of their sponsor slots, they’d make $5,997 per send — over $1.5M per year.
<strong>7) The Generalist</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1.5M-$3M
Newsletter subscribers: 100,000
Monetization type: Paid newsletter and community, Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, collaborations, Substack Recommendations
Team size: 2
The Generalist is a newsletter that analyzes tech and VC.
The 100,000+ subscribers are monetized with a paid subscription and newsletter sponsorships.
If 5% of subscribers convert to the $220/year subscription, that’s $1.1M in ARR.
Sponsorship revenue is harder to estimate. But it’s lucrative. The Generalist has a huge audience of founders and VCs with high net worths.
<strong>8) Marketing Examined</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$1-$2M
Newsletter subscribers: 100,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships
Growth method: Twitter, Meta ads
Team size: 1
This marketing newsletter did $100k in ad sales back in February of 2023.
They announced they plan to hit $2M ARR this year.
<strong>9) Marketing Examples</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$600k-$1M
Newsletter subscribers: 120,000+
Monetization type: Sponsorships, coaching, courses
Growth method: Content distribution, Twitter, word of mouth
Team size: 1
Marketing Examples is a marketing and copywriting newsletter founded by Harry Dry.
He sells ads in his newsletter and website. If all inventory is sold these placements will result in $450k per year in ad sales.
Harry also offers 1on1 coaching for $900 — if he sells 3 calls per week, that’s an extra $140K in annual revenue.
Plus, Harry has a course he’s sold in the past. Course revenue can likely surpass ad and coaching revenue when it is live.
<strong>10) UI Dev</strong>
Estimated annual revenue: ~$2M-$4M
Newsletter subscribers: 225,000+
Monetization type: Courses, Sponsorships
Growth method: Word of mouth, SEO, YouTube, Paid ads
Team size: 4
UI Dev is a media and education company for front-end developers.
They have 225k newsletter subscribers and 80k course customers.
They have 8 courses that are $149 each. Customers can buy those or get access to all courses plus more content for $495 per year.
For sponsorships, we can assume a $50 CPM on opens.
At 170k subscribers, 2 sends per week, and a 45% open rate, that’s $397,800 in sponsorships revenue.
Then if 2% of newsletter subscribers buy their annual course subscription at $499/year, that’s $1,696,600 in ARR.</a></li><li><a href=#new-highlights-added-november-29-2023-at-1230-pm>New highlights added November 29, 2023 at 12:30 PM</a></li></ol></nav></details></aside><a href=#tweets-from-matt-mcgarry><h1 id=tweets-from-matt-mcgarry><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tweets From Matt McGarry</h1></a><p><img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1372970972123381772/bOnuyg5t.jpg width=auto alt=rw-book-cover></p><a href=#metadata><h2 id=metadata><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Author: <a class="internal-link broken">@JMatthewMcGarry on Twitter</a></li><li>Full Title: Tweets From Matt McGarry</li><li>Category: #tweets</li><li>URL:

Here’s how I did it.
Plus what worked, what okay worked, and what failed:
<strong>The First 100 Subscribers</strong>
I got the first 100 by:<ul><li>Twitter and LinkedIn posts to my ~800 followers (drove 75 subscribers)</li><li>Added a CTA for my newsletter in my email signature (drove ~10 subscribers)</li><li>Asked close friends and clients to subscribe (drove ~15 subscribers)
After that, I needed to hone in on acquisition channels….
<strong>What Worked Great</strong>
<em><strong>Twitter - 4,219 subscribers, 65% open rate, 26% CTR</strong></em>
Writing 1 thread per week and posting every day has had the largest impact on my newsletter growth.
Also, optimizing my profile was key in converting views into subscribers.
Think of your profile as an ad for people to follow you and join your newsletter.
Work on improving every element of that “ad” — Your profile picture, header, description, location, etc.
Next, I turned to paid…
<em><strong>Twitter Ads - 2,314 subscribers, 60% open rate, 13% CTR</strong></em>
I’ve spent $6,231 on Twitter ads to acquire 2,314 subscribers at a $2.69 CPA (cost per subscriber)
I offset my ad investment with Sparkloop Upscribe and beehiiv boosts.
With these tools I’m able to earn ~$1 per subscriber, making my net CPA $1.69.
<strong>What Kinda Worked</strong>
<em><strong>Referral program - 339 subscribers, 49% open rate, 20% CTR</strong></em>
Users unlock a reward after referring 1 subscriber.
These can be great for more popular niches, but can be tough for niches with smaller overall interest.
<em><strong>Cross-promotions - 250 subscribers, 70% open rate, 30% CTR</strong></em>
These were hit or miss.
Some of mine generated 100+ subscribers, some generated under 10.
However, cross-promos have generated some of my highest-quality subscribers.
<em><strong>beehiiv boosts - 411 subscribers, 44% open rate, 8% CTR</strong></em>
Boosts are a great way to grow with paid ads if you don&rsquo;t have the time or skill for FB or Twitter ads.
They&rsquo;re mostly automated.
<strong>What Didn’t Work</strong>
<em><strong>Newsletter ads - ~150 subscribers, ~65% open rate</strong></em>
I bought 4 ads in other newsletters. 3 flopped, 1 worked well.
Small sample size, but not great results.
I&rsquo;ll test this again later using CPC deals and beehiiv&rsquo;s ad network.
<em><strong>Facebook ads - 100 subscribers, 25% open rate</strong></em>
I spent $589 on FB ads to acquire 100 subscribers at a $5.89 CPA (cost per subscriber).
FB ads are amazing but they didn’t work out well for me (yet).
My content is niche and I didn’t do much creative testing.
<strong>Here’s a breakdown of where all subscribers are from:</strong></li><li>Twitter organic: 4,219</li><li>Twitter ads: 2,921</li><li>Website direct: 1,333</li><li>Google organic: 548</li><li>Beehiiv boosts: 367</li><li>Referral: 346</li><li>Other: 2,617
Hope this helps!
I&rsquo;ll report back at 20k subscribers. (

When people are reading they&rsquo;re more likely to stick around (retention) and to share it (acquisition).
How do you measure and improve engagement?
Unfortunately, open rates are no longer the answer.
<strong>Here&rsquo;s what to use instead&mldr;</strong>
The engagement metrics you should track and prioritize (in order):<ol><li>CTR</li><li>Poll responses</li><li>Reply rate</li><li>Open rate
(Always use unique clicks, CTR, replies, and opens).
<strong>Why is open rate not #1?</strong>
Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) killed open rate.
To oversimplify it - MPP &ldquo;opens&rdquo; emails even if they&rsquo;re not opened. This makes open rate metrics unreliable.
And MMP is impacting <strong>55%+ of opens</strong>.
You should still track and consider open rates, but clicks are king now.
Think about it:
The only reliable way subscribers add value to your newsletter is by clicking a:</li></ol><ul><li>Sponsors link</li><li>Product link</li><li>Or any link (which improves your deliverability)
You have no idea if a person who opened actually read the newsletter&mldr;
Or if that open was automated by MPP.
So what should you do now?
<strong>Use more links and ask people to click them.</strong>
Here’s how:</li><li>Add more contextual links to other content/products (ideally your content).</li><li>Add more call-to-actions for your products/sponsors.</li><li>Include a curated link section in your newsletter.</li><li>Ask people to click a link to stay subscribed</li><li>Use polls
<strong>Use a poll in every newsletter send</strong>
I like this &ldquo;5 star, 3 star, 1 star&rdquo; format:
Aim for 80%+ 5-star reviews and more poll responses each send.
Hope this helps! (

• Events
• Agency
• Courses
• Affiliates
• Speaking
• Coaching
• Job board
• Consulting
• Mastermind
• Sponsorships
• Paid newsletter
• Lead generation
• Paid community
• Data subscription
There&rsquo;s more.
But these are generally the best fit for media founders.
If you only use sponsors and affiliates you need to start selling a product/service asap.
If you&rsquo;re starting a newsletter, think about your product/service offer from day 1.
The best newsletters are distribution channels for a high LTV product &ndash; not just a place to sell ads. (
