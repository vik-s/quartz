*&ldquo;This is a story about a tiger named Mohini that was in captivity in a zoo, who was rescued from an animal sanctuary. Mohini had been confined to a 10-by-10-foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10-by-10 feet was worn bare of grass. . . . Perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns.&rdquo; *
<strong>What past limitations—real or perceived—are you carrying as baggage? Where in your life are you pacing in a 10-by-10-foot patch of grass? Where are you afraid of getting sprayed with water, even though it’s never happened? Oftentimes, everything you want is a mere inch outside of your comfort zone. Test it.</strong> (

**Even if you don’t consider yourself a writer (I never did), putting thoughts on paper is the best way to A) develop ideas, and B) review and improve your thinking. **
The benefits of even 30 minutes a week of scribbling can transfer to everything else that you do.
The following bullets are writing prompts that Cheryl Strayed (@CherylStrayed) has suggested when asked for assignment ideas for students who’ve read <em>Wild</em>.
They are brilliant and make fantastic jumping-off points for any type of journaling or writing, whether Morning Pages, a blog post, the beginning of a novel, a letter to a friend, a diary entry, a screenplay, or a too-fast-too-soon Tinder message.
**Try one for two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and don’t stop to edit. Step one is to generate without judging. Chances are that you’ll surprise yourself. **
Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken.
Write about a lesson you learned the hard way.
Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion.
Write about something you lost that you’ll never get back.
Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing.
Write about something you don’t remember.
Write about your darkest teacher.
Write about a memory of a physical injury.
Write about when you knew it was over.
Write about being loved.
Write about what you were really thinking.
Write about how you found your way back.
Write about the kindness of strangers.
Write about why you could not do it.
Write about why you did. (

They’re attractive for many reasons: developing new business skills, developing a better business network, or—most often—taking what is effectively a two-year vacation that looks good on a resume.
In 2001, and again in 2004, I wanted to do all three things.
I was ready to apply to Stanford Business School. Who wouldn’t be?
I enthusiastically began a process I would repeat twice: downloading the application to get started, taking the full campus tour, and sitting in on other classes.
Some were incredible, taught by all-stars who’d done it all, but others—many others—were taught by PhD theoreticians who used big words and lots of Powerpoint slides. One teacher spent 45 minutes on slide after slide of equations that could be summed up with “If you build a crappy product, people won’t buy it.” No one needed to prove that to me with differential calculus.
At the end of that class, I turned to my student guide for the tour and asked him how it compared to other classes. He answered: “Oh, this is easily my favorite.”
That was the death of business school for me.
By 2005, I was done chasing my tail with business school, but I still ached to learn more.
Then, in 2007, I started having more frequent lunches with the brilliant Mike Maples, Jr (@m2jr).
Our conversations usually bounced between a few topics, including physical performance, marketing campaigns (I’d just launched The 4-Hour Workweek), and his latest focus: angel investing.
“Angel investing” involves putting relatively small amounts of money—often from $15,000 to $100,000—into early-stage start-ups. In Mike’s world, “early-stage” could mean two engineers with a prototype for a website, or it could mean a successful serial entrepreneur with a new idea. The angels usually have relevant business experience and are considered “smart money”—their advice and introductions are just as valuable as the money they put in.
After several lunches with Mike, I’d found my business school.
I decided to make (in my mind) a two-year “Tim Ferriss Fund” that would replace Stanford business school.
Stanford GSB isn’t cheap. I rounded it down to $60,000 a year, for a total of $120,000 over two years (these days, it’s $100,000+ per year).
For the “Tim Ferriss Fund,” I would aim to intelligently spend $120,000 over two years on angel investing in $10-20,000 chunks, so 6-12 companies in total. The goal of this “business school” would be to learn as much as possible about start-up finance, deal structuring, rapid product design, initiating acquisition conversations, etc. as possible.
The curriculum could be thought of as “The Start-up Lifecycle from Birth to Acquisition/IPO or Death.” But curriculum was just part of business school; the other part was getting to know the “students,” preferably the most astute movers and shakers in the start-up investing world. Business school = curriculum + network.
The most important characteristic of my personal MBA: <strong>I planned on “losing” $120,000.</strong>
I went into the “Tim Ferriss Fund” viewing the $120,000 as sunk tuition costs, but also expecting that the lessons learned, and people met, would be worth that $120,000 investment. <strong>The two-year plan was to methodically spend $120,000 for the learning experience, not for the ROI.</strong>
I would <em><strong>not</strong></em> suggest mimicking this approach:<ol><li>Unless you have a clear informational advantage—insider access—that gives you a competitive advantage. I lived in the nexus of Silicon Valley and knew many top CEOs and investors, so I had better sources of information than the vast majority of the world. I don’t invest in public companies precisely because I know that professionals have better access to information than I do.</li><li>Unless you are 100% comfortable losing your “MBA” funds. You should only gamble with what you’re very comfortable losing. If financial loss drives you to even mild desperation or depression, you shouldn’t do it.</li><li>Unless you have started and/or managed successful businesses in the past.</li><li>Unless you limit angel investment funds to 10% or less of your liquid assets. I subscribe to the Nassim Taleb school of investment, with 90% in conservative asset classes and the remaining 10% in speculative investments that can capitalize on positive “black swans”. (
<a href=https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1716800593719689491 rel=noopener>View Tweet</a>)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):</strong><ol><li>Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.</li><li>Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.</li><li>Write down the 3-5 things—and no more—that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually = most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict.</li><li>For each item, ask yourself:
– “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?”
– “Will moving this forward make all the other to-do’s unimportant or easier to knock off later?”</li><li>Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions.</li><li>Block out at least 2-3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.</li><li>TO BE CLEAR: Block out at least 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work.</li><li>If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.
Congratulations! That’s it.
This is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my never-ending impulse to procrastinate, nap, and otherwise fritter away my days with bullshit.
If I have 10 important things to do in a day, it’s 100% certain nothing important will get done that day. On the other hand, I can usually handle 1 must-do item and block out my lesser behaviors for 2-3 hours a day. (

Days and even weeks when you want to (or perhaps do) pull up the covers and half-sleep in bed until nightfall, avoiding a feeling of hopelessness that seems insurmountable. Long-awaited deals fall through without warning, haters attack you without reason or fact, circumstances turn good decisions into awful realities—sometimes it just feels like the deck is stacked against you and there is nothing you can do about it.
I’ve felt the same on more than a few occasions.
It’s an integral part of building anything remarkable, whether a business, a relationship, or a life. <strong>Expanding your sphere of comfort and abilities comes with a cost: repeated self-doubt.</strong>
Meditate on all of the things you’ve done that you once considered impossible. The odds you’ve overcome, the critics you’ve proven wrong, and the small defeats that — through making you stronger and smarter — made huge victories possible later.
Get back up. Bigger and better things are waiting for you. (

This post is minimally edited. I’m not trying to be Tolstoy; rather, I wanted to share a quick and dirty email of tactical advice to a friend who has limited time, a bunch of kids, etc.  
I’m also simplifying a lot to get my point across quickly, so read it with that in mind. Needless to say, I’m not a doctor and none of this is medical advice. Chat with your MD and do your homework on supplements before consuming anything new.
My friend is also a roughly 200-pound male, so adjust kettlebell weights accordingly. Pavel Tsatsouline has excellent further resources.
Enjoy…<h3 id=heading></h3>Ahoy, Santiago!
If you follow the directions in the below links for four weeks, you should see some significant changes.
First, just a few basics:
– Weight training will help with fat loss and appearance more than cardio, as it helps to build muscle, which then changes your metabolism.
– As they say, “Abs are made in the kitchen.” We all have abs, and it’s diet that will make them visible or invisible, so diet is 90%-plus of seeing abs.
– Supplements can be helpful, but they are called “supplements” for a reason. They should supplement other more important changes to diet and exercise.
OK, here are my suggestions for the next 4–6 weeks, listed from most important to least important:
DIET
Focus on the Slow-Carb Diet. You get one “cheat day” per week to go crazy and eat whatever you want, so you’re not giving up your favorite foods for more than 6 days at a time. It really, really works.
These two articles are good starting points:

EXERCISE
Focus on kettlebell swings. Do these 2x per week and see these, in this order:<ol><li><a href=https://t.co/LFe547BPmL rel=noopener>https://t.co/LFe547BPmL</a></li><li>The Perfect Posterior: Kettlebell Swings and Cheap Alternatives (

Here’s an excerpt from the above blog post:
<em>In 2005, my interest in kettlebells reinvigorated, I returned to the United States from Argentina and purchased one 53-pound kettlebell. I did nothing more than one set of 75 swings one hour after a light, protein-rich breakfast, twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. In the beginning, I couldn’t complete 75 consecutive repetitions, so I did multiple sets with 60 seconds between until I totaled 75. Total swing time for the entire week was 10–20 minutes.</em>
<em>I wasn’t trying to balance tequila shots on my butt cheeks. I wanted clear six-pack abs. In six weeks, I was at my lowest bodyfat percentage since 1999, and l’d reached my goal. I’ve since worked up to 50+ reps with the 106-lb. “beast,” which has directly transferred to 100-lb.+ gains in the deadlift.</em>
<em>The king of exercises—the two-handed kettlebell swing—is all you need for dramatic changes.</em>
BASICS
Get a 35-lb kettlebell and a ~53-lb kettlebell to start. Do one week of the lighter then move up to the 53. After the 4–6 week experiment, you might buy one that is heavier. Good idea to use chalk on your hands.
SUPPLEMENTS
– Eat 30 grams (30g) of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. I know this isn’t a supplement, but it’s important, so I’m putting it here, since I think you might skip to this section. 🙂
– Consider 1000mg of cissus quadrangularis before lunch.
– Take 100–300mg of alpha-lipoic acid 30 min before dinner.
– Take 3,000–5,000iu of vitamin D before bed.
For now, that’s PLENTY!
The 4-Hour Body will have much more to explore, if you like. Hardcover will be on its way to you.
Un abrazo!
Tim</li></ol><h3 id=heading-1></h3>P.S. To bring some optimism into 2024, I’d like to quote from an email I received at the end of 2008 from a mentor of more than two decades:
W<em>hile many are wringing their hands, I recall the 1970s when we were suffering from an oil shock causing long lines at gas stations, rationing, and 55 MPH speed limits on Federal highways, a recession, very little venture capital ($50 million per year into VC firms), and, what President Jimmy Carter (wearing a sweater while addressing the Nation on TV because he had turned down the heat in the White House) called a “malaise.” It was during those times that two kids without any real college education, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, started companies that did pretty well. Opportunities abound in bad times as well as good times. In fact, the opportunities are often greater when the conventional wisdom is that everything is going into the toilet.

W</em>ell…we’re nearing the end of another great year, and, despite what we read about the outlook for 2009, we can look forward to a New Year filled with opportunities as well as stimulating challenges.

Once again, Happy New Year, everyone! (
