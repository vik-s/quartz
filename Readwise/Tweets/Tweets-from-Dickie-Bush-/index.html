It&rsquo;s packed with actionable tips on how to:
• Avoid jargon
• Organize your writing
• Use adjectives & adverbs
It&rsquo;s truly the <em>bible</em> of business writing.

8 lessons & realizations on airports & flying:<ol><li><strong>When in an airport, never sit & never scroll.</strong> Take a walk, do some stretching, stay moving, etc. You’re about to sit & scroll for multiple hours in a row once you’re on the plane.
2.** Board in Group 1, no matter your group.** 99% of the time they don&rsquo;t say anything. Worst case they tell you to wait, then you&rsquo;re first when they call your actual group.</li><li><strong>Never buy the WiFi.</strong> It&rsquo;s the only time in the last month you haven&rsquo;t had access to the internet. Use time to think/write/read/let your mind wander.
4.** Economy class is like a public bus in the sky. <strong>It’s worth it to upgrade, not for what you get, but for what you don’t have to deal with. It’s also proven you cannot think big picture about your business unless you’re in business class. Will not explain.
5.</strong> Never check a bag. **Their are zero incentives for the service crew to 1) take care of your bag 2) make sure it gets to its destination. Carry-on only.</li><li>**Make a note in your phone called &ldquo;airplane journal.&rdquo; **Write a quick entry any time you&rsquo;re in the air. Talk about life, where you&rsquo;re going, who you&rsquo;re seeing, how you&rsquo;re feeling. You&rsquo;ll look back in 10 years thrilled you logged all your travels.</li><li>**TSA Pre is a laughably underpriced service. **$100 to save you dozens of hours every year for 5 years. I actually cannot believe some people don’t have this. If you still take your shoes off at the airport… nvm.</li><li><strong>Download your favorite albums & most impactful podcasts to Spotify.</strong> Listen to the albums in order as the artist intended. Relisten to the podcasts and you’ll pick up on some ideas you missed the first time around.<img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GDFQTWcX0AABZUl.jpg> (

Most people hate to hear that as the answer, but it’s the truth.
When I was working on Wall Street I woke up at 4:30 AM damn near every day for 2 years to write for 2 hours before getting to my desk at 7 AM.
It’s a fallacy to think “once I quit my job, then I’ll find something to look forward to working on.”
You have to find that thing, pursue it with intensity that others would find unreasonable, and keep doing that every day until it no longer makes financial sense for you to keep your full-time job.
This is what worked for me brother.
Hope it helps ✊ (

I call this “<strong>Calendar Mining.</strong>”
Here’s how it works in 3 steps:
<strong>Step 1</strong>: Every morning when I sit down to write, I pop open my calendar.
<strong>Step 2:</strong> I scan each and every entry from the day before and the day ahead.
<strong>Step 3:</strong> For each entry, I think about what I could share that would be:
• Useful to me (meaning I gain something from writing about it)
• Useful to one reader (meaning someone would benefit from reading it)
For example, just yesterday, in my calendar I had:
• An in-person podcast
• Two hours of lifting & yoga
• Two hours of employee 1:1s
• My morning priming routine
• My morning mobility routine
• Each of my meals mapped out
• My end-of-day reflection process
• This writing brainstorming session
• Time to FaceTime with my girlfriend
• A scheduled block to listen to an audiobook
• Time for reading & winding down to end the day
Each of these “blocks” is ripe with potential frameworks, lessons, and breakdowns that I’m *already doing *but just need to formalize and write up.
As a result, I’m in my best writing flow state in years—for 3 reasons:
<strong>Reason #1: This guarantees the writing is useful to me</strong>
This takes away the downside from any time invested in writing.
Worst case, zero people read it but I better distill something for myself, which is a win.
The lens here is, “Would I write about this if no one could read it?”
If the answer is yes, I should write about it no matter what.
<strong>Reason #2: This guarantees the writing is written from a 1st-person perspective</strong>
The most memorable ideas are always supported by a personal story or example.
And this writing style ensures I can pair the framework with something that will help the reader remember it in the future.
<strong>Reason #3: It’s helping me test new topics I could potentially expand in the future</strong>
Many of the recent ideas I’ve written about have been personal systems that I’ve used for years.
And since I’ve used them for years, they’ve become extremely obvious to me.
And since they’re extremely obvious to me… I assume other people would find them obvious as well.
But just after a few days of writing about things I haven’t written too much about in the past (my fitness routines, my approach to employee 1:1s, thoughts on travel, etc.) I’ve found this isn’t the case.
And as a result, I have several new content buckets I can expand on in the future.
<strong>Reason #4: This unlocks a much simpler writing style because I’m just saying what happened rather than trying to teach anything</strong>
This helps me frame the writing as “here’s what I’m doing” rather than “here’s what you should do.”
It’s like I’m having a conversation with someone who asked me about the topic. I’m just answering their questions.
<em>Now, to get &ldquo;meta&rdquo; for a second…</em>
I’m literally practicing what I preach as I write this entire piece.
• It’s written in the first person
• This is an example from my calendar
• It’s written in a conversational writing style
• I’m giving you tangible examples that give context to the framework
Worst case, no one reads it (but I better understand my own framework).
Best case, someone finds it valuable, tries it in their own life, and shares it with their friends in the future.
And since you my dear reader are reading this sentence right now, you are that someone.
And on and on my writing flywheel spins.<img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEdDClvXAAARvYL.jpg> (
<a href=https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1749440720492957915 rel=noopener>View Tweet</a>)</li></ul><a href=#new-highlights-added-february-1-2024-at-921-am><h2 id=new-highlights-added-february-1-2024-at-921-am><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>New highlights added February 1, 2024 at 9:21 AM</h2></a><ul><li>I&rsquo;m writing every day in 2024.
9 reasons why:
<strong>1. Every piece of writing I publish is a lottery ticket</strong>
The world’s most interesting, wealthy, and successful people all use the same social media algorithm.
And this means you never know on whose timeline your writing might end up.
If I’m putting out consistent, quality ideas, there’s a good chance someone I look up to stumbles upon it.
To me, this is the modern-day version of “networking.”
Rather than wasting time thinking about how I can reach out to the people I look up to, I’m investing time in publishing ideas that make them want to reach out to me.
<strong>2. Writing every day helps me think clearly</strong>
I use my morning writing time as a “container” to process whatever is going on in my life.
Business, health, relationships, everything—I can only fully understand what’s going on once I’ve distilled it into writing.
So my goal is to do some kind of distillation every morning—whether it’s journaling, writing up plans for me & my team, or talking about ideas I’m interested in (that readers would find interesting as well).
<strong>3. Writing every day helps me speak clearly</strong>
The people who sound sharp in speeches and on podcasts have a secret.
They’re not “riffing off the cuff” — they simply answer questions by repeating ideas they’ve written about hundreds of times.
And since they’ve written about them, they’ve taken the time to think through them (which is why they sound clear).
<strong>4. Writing every day helps me learn rapidly</strong>
The fastest way to learn something is to:
• Have a project in which you can apply the learning
• Share those learnings in public
Why?
This creates a “lens” through which you will consume that information.
Rather than just consume information for the sake of it, you’re going to think about how you could distill and clarify it for yourself and the reader.
And that extra time of thinking through the idea is where the “leaps” of learning happen.
<strong>5. Every single person I look up to writes consistently</strong>
There are millions of successful investors and entrepreneurs.
But the ones who I admire the most all have one thing in common:
They publish their ideas for their customers, shareholders, and partners to read.
Howard Marks, Warren Buffet, Naval Ravikant, Tim Ferriss, Jeff Bezos: the list goes on and on.
<strong>6. Writing helps me attract new opportunities passively</strong>
At this point, 90% of the people I talk to on a regular basis I met through my writing.
Team members, business partners, collaborators, friends, and even my girlfriend I met at a coffee shop while I was writing.
Why?
Every piece of writing I publish gives someone a “jumping off point” to reach out to me.
If the piece resonates with them, they can shoot me a DM with context to start a conversation. And chances are, if someone is interested in similar ideas to me (like the ones I’m writing about), we’re going to get along.
<strong>7. Writing is my “keystone” morning habit</strong>
I have a block on my calendar every morning from 6 AM to 7:30 AM that says “Writing.”
Every morning, no matter how I’m feeling or what is going on in my life, I sit down to process ideas.
And with each day I log my writing time, I’m reinforcing a personal identity of consistency.
This identity then spreads to every other area of my life. I’m more dialed in on the fitness front, my sleep is better, my diet is better, and I’m more present in conversation.
The reverse also holds true—any time these other areas feel out of whack, it’s because I’ve fallen off my daily writing habit.
<strong>8. Writing has zero downside and infinite upside</strong>
In the world of investing, winning comes from taking “convex bets” — where there’s a little bit of downside but a massive upside.
Writing is one of those convex bets—except I’ve yet to find any downside.
Worst case, you spend hours writing something that no one reads. But you’re still winning because you better understand the idea and you&rsquo;ve improved your writing skill.
Best case, that piece of writing changes your life. It attracts a job opportunity, or sparks a business idea, or leads to a lifelong friendship.
(And this is exactly what happened to me.)
<strong>9. Writing is the best way to document the journey</strong>
I know when I’m 85 years old, I will wish I had a paper trail of the entire journey.
The highs & lows.
The moments of despair & the moments of euphoria.
The painful days trying to make something work, followed shortly by the breakthrough idea.
And my writing is the best way to freeze those moments in time.
—
Aaand that’s it. Feeling in absolute flow so far in 2024, and it’s all because of my daily writing habit.
Highly recommend giving it a try ✊

“Operate in a surplus”
I see a lot of people say relationships shouldn’t be <em>transactional</em>
I disagree.
Every relationship is transactional.
Thinking otherwise goes against human nature.
And this lens has improved all of my relationships.
Here’s why:
Every person I come across, I think about ways to give without asking.
And this puts me in a surplus.
<strong>• Random service worker?</strong> Let’s make their day better with a nice conversation and complimenting their outfit
<strong>• Hotel concierge?</strong> Let’s genuinely thank them and tip them well from the beginning
**• Best friends? **Constantly send them valuable content. Hype up & support their products
<strong>• Significant other?</strong> Find ways to make things easier for them. Proactively make them feel valued, heard, and loved
<strong>• Parents?</strong> You’re likely in a massive deficit to them, so better start calling them more, supporting them, and chipping away at it
<strong>• Employees?</strong> Invest in their development, proactively coach them, find ways to praise them when doing the little things right
<strong>• Your audience?</strong> Give them valuable information without asking them to buy or do anything in return
<strong>• Someone you look up to?</strong> Don’t ask them a question or “pick their brain” — find a way to create something worth their time to engage with
Day-to-day interactions, customers, readers, viewers, friends, family, and significant others—you can use this simple idea for everyone.
And the reason this works in strengthening relationships is through a simple human bias called “reciprocity.”
Basically, we like to give to people who give to us first.
In fact, we almost feel “obliged” to do so.
And this mutual “giving” creates a powerful flywheel—you give to someone, which makes them want to give back to you, which makes you want to give back to them, and on and on and on.<img src=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFk7rIsW4AARcJC.png> (
