Hello! 👋🏽 Welcome to my online notes repository, which is my attempt to do my thinking and learning on a global stage, and hopefully interact with some fine human beings along the way!

A lot of the content will dynamically change as my perspectives evolve, but that is the point of it. You'll see unfinished work, blatant mistakes, complete misunderstandings, and hopefully something that you will like and use in your own thinking. So like everything on the internet, take what you will with a pinch of salt.

Here's what I am up to [[now]].
