Hello! 👋🏽 Welcome to my online notes repository, which is my attempt to do my thinking and learning on a global stage, and hopefully interact with some fine human beings along the way!

A lot of the content will dynamically change as my perspectives evolve, but hopefully you will see something that you will like and use in your own thinking. Like everything on the internet, take what you will with a pinch of salt.

Here's what I am up to [[blog/_now|now]]. You can go through my [[blog/_reading|reading list]], for which I've started taking notes as much as I can. I enjoy listening to several longform [[blog/_podcasts|podcasts]].
