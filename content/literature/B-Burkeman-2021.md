## Introduction: In the long run, we're all dead

* We have 4000 weeks to live. Thats very short in the grand scheme of things. This book is about facing that fact, and accepting that we will never get everything done
* Productivity has become: how do we cram most number of tasks into as little time as possible
* We all regret "wasting" time when we are either too busy (no time to do what I want) or when having too much time (what should i have really been doing with my time?), because we are aware that time is limited.
* Contrast life to a conveyor belt:
	* Tasks keep coming and we are supposed to get it done
	* We use productivity tools and shave time off each task
	* This causes conveyor below to move faster -> more tasks
- John Maynard Keene predicted that we will have 15 hour work weeks soon. He was wrong. We work more than ever now
- Busyness has become a symbol of prestige, which is strange because the goal of getting rich is to not work as hard.
* We yearn to spend time in more meaningful ways:
	* desire to devote to larger cause
	* having day job to cover what you really want to do

### 1: The limit embracing life

- We need new ideas about how to think about the limited time we have and how we use it.
- Each hour of life is a container on the conveyor belt of life that we feel we have to fill with something
- Before timetables were existed, people were mostly task-oriented. Do the task when it is necessary, no scheduling
- This gives rise to a sense of timelessness that Richard Rohr calls living in deep time. We get this sensation when we see big landscapes where we lose ourselves for a moment.
- We have started treating time as a resource, and feel like we dont have enough or wasting too much. Trying to make better use of time, we push ourselves harder even when there is no need to. It never feels like you do well enough.
- Accept reality: time is short, you will never do all you want. Be guided by the time it inherently takes to do something, called *Eigenzeit* in German. Resist the need to do everything, and let time be your guide.

### 2: The Efficiency Trap

- What is it?
		- We believe we can get more efficient at doing our tasks and then "make time" for the things that really matter.
	- Parkinson's law will ensure that work always baloons to fill the time available.
	- Hard choices should be made: you have to give up something to make time for something else.
	- Instead of getting things done, you will add more things to do
- You will not get it all done; just focus on the ones that count
- Existential overwhelm: You want the get all of life experiences and push yourself to do so. Life has infinite experiences to offer, you can't have all of them. Enjoy the tiny slices of experiences you actually do have
- If the goal is to clear your to-do list, you will end up doing the meaningless small tasks first instead of the important ones. So accept the fact that your to-do list will always have things on it, just prioritize better on the important things
- By using convenience tools to eradicate life's seemingly tedious tasks, you often remove meaning and connection from your life.

### 3: Facing Finitude

- The early part of this chapter focuses on the fact that life will ultimately end; momento mori- remember that you will die. This might serve as a reminder to people who live very fast paced lives without stopping to think.
- It usually happens that you face a moment of clarity when faced with finitude, like death or a terminal illness. We should not wait until that moment to realize that time is our most valuable asset.

### 4: Become a better procrastinator
- learn to neglect the right things, or the *art of creative neglect*.
	- Pay yourself first when it comes to time.
		- Use your primetime hours to do what is most important to you
		- If you are waiting to start a creative project, a social cause or anything that matters to you, at a later date, "when you have the time", dont. Start today, however small.
		- Protect time by scheduling meetings with yourself
	- Limit your number of concurrent projects
		- Do not work on more than 3 concurrent projects at once. If you need to add more, remove one from the list first.
		- Feel free to abandon a project if it isnt working out
		- Limit the number of half-finished projects
		- Define your projects in managable chunks, and work on actively finishing them. Something like "get better at music" is too broad. Pick a song you want to learn. This would avoid the project from clogging up the system when something more interesting comes along
	- Learn to say no to projects you *do* want to do
		- There will be many projects that you will want to do
		- Learn to actively say no to them. This is the way to focus on your priorities
- We fear committing to a single path in projects or relationships. We have the fear of missing out on possibilities that could have been. We live out a perfect fantasy in our heads, and escape when reality does not meet that perfect expectation. A fine example is Franz Kafka's relationship with his fiance Felice Bauer.
- You must settle on something, in order to strive to get better at it. You have to commit to an instrument you want to play, for example. Switching all the time will scatter your efforts needlessly.
- I disagree with Burkeman that one should have a child to "settle" and find happiness. Yes, children are great, but its a responsibiliy that not all are cut out or want to begin with.
- Once you make a choice to settle on something, anxiety falls away and now you can move forward with purpose

### 5: The watermelon problem
- People spent 40 mins watching a TV show where people were putting rubber bands on a watermelon till it burst. This seeming utter waste of time, seems a much better source of entertainment than how we spend our time "doomscrolling" on social media.
- What you apply your attention to, is what dictates how you spend your life energy. Social media is a machine designed to collect your attention reserves for profit, and most people give away too much of their attention (life energy) to social media without realizing it. 

### 6: The intimate interruptor
- Why do we so readily get distracted from hard tasks (like our job, or reading, or pracitisng an instrument)? We are the ones that distract ourselves ultimately.  Burkeman suggests that this is because of our awareness of finitude.
	- I disagree with this dramatic explanation of a fact that is much better explained with how social media is designed to deliver instant dopamine hits which the mind starts to crave. Most tasks worth doing do not give instant gratificaation. Finitude has nothing to do with it. It's a weak explanation attempting to shoehorn this observation into the theme of this book.
- Burkeman suggests that there is nothing we can do to avoid distracting ourselves all the time. That aall techniques such as focus music, meditation, etc are pointless.
	- I disagree with this because it has been shown that binaural beats increase focus, and meditation has far reaching impacts on the body and mind even if done only for 17 minutes a day (heard from Huberman lab podcast). Again, the author paints a hopeless picture that we are supposed to accept.
- We distract ourselves from our work, because we know what we can achieve is finite and limited. We can build in our imagination a perfect world, but reality usually falls short and we avoid facing this reality.

### 7: We never really have time
- Douglas Hofstadter jokingly said- Any task will take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law. For example, the sydney opera house took 14 years instead of the planned 4 years.
- In trying to plan everything ahead of time to perfection, so that you will be able to avoid an outcome you do not want, you often cause more anxiety to yourself instead of facing the actual consequencies would cause themselves.
- We strive to control our time and refuse to accept our limitations.

### Quotes

>“We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life,” wrote Nietzsche, “because to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.”
