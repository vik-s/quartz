## Highlights
- I hated writing in high school. It wasn’t objective like my favorite subjects, math and science. It also didn’t help that we had to write about old, hard-to-understand literature like Shakespeare. But my perspective on writing changed once I started working full-time as a software engineer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbcvj0eek5jgmb7j7jazhfz))
    - Note: When the writer was in high school, they didn't like writing because it wasn't like their favorite subjects, math and science. They also had to write about old, hard-to-understand books like Shakespeare. But when they became a software engineer, they realized that writing was an important part of their job.
- Aside from being a necessity, writing is the most efficient way for you to scale yourself. As a concrete example, I have a friend who takes incredible notes at work. His notes become a wiki of common terminal commands, code pointers, and diagrams for the team he works on. The best part is that his writing helps others move faster without any work on his part after sharing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbcsy6jb10z4r54bmj9d03a))
- Writing is the most scalable way to influence others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbct6ddvvnp3ab722s1rmtq))
- Reading won't be obsolete till writing is, and writing won't be obsolete till thinking is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbcv1x7pnqdzfyq3k9hj2xg))
