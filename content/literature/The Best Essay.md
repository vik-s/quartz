- Summary: The document explores the concept of what constitutes the best essay, emphasizing the importance of surprising readers with new insights rather than sticking to traditional or expected topics. It delves into the process of writing essays, highlighting the need for a compelling initial question to guide the exploration of ideas and the importance of continuous revision and refinement in essay writing. The text also touches on the idea of timelessness in essays, suggesting that truly timeless essays are those that present information in such detail that it cannot be culturally transmitted, ensuring continued surprise and relevance for future readers.

- My goal here is to figure out what the best essay would be like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00fhe9tp8exd2pay0sdw1b))
- Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing this that the best essay would be fairly timeless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00dcqmsm4rq8mffc2r9shz))
- But in fact the opposite seems to be true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00dm81cw27yjzv4dxkw4sv))
- The best essay *now* would be one describing a great discovery we didn't yet know about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00e1dks5bcwk49jz21bkd5))
- Instead of asking *what would the best essay be?* I should have asked *how do you write essays well?* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00g7r9fsgqpv3krf5vctt9))
- The answer to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay writing. The second question forces it to be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00h07hgjv09ya1fya6q131))
- Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00hh047n89s13wjew86z1p))
- An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like one in the sense that it spurs some response. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00jzsw21gsgjhxgbbp8weq))
- you shouldn't attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about it or way of approaching it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00kxr8hk6b66j8823nwsv3))
- You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about something other people take for granted can be edge enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00n0z9dvn4w1tzz58gbcd9))
- Many an important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed insignificant at first ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00nws30v27m2saafs2qp3q))
- Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00qdc2w39kkfaytke5andh))
- At least half of essay writing is rereading what you've written and asking *is this correct and complete?* You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00t0p2nm3jsgd5qp3696k6))
- Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process continues recursively, as response spurs response. [[5](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f5n)] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00y4xdsxhw7nc9eb96sg84))
- Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point. How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the greatest combination of generality and novelty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00yfqkeyycgtxj80qyff3h))
- In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep something that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits or cost you a lot of effort. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs00zzdz7ry29r6zxcac58kk))
- The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is *does it really matter what the initial question is?* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs014sc91tchz6pp1bkp4bkm))
- The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually feel somewhat obliged to stick to it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs015dtdxqsnz2tsf7d0ffdn))
- You don't want the hunt for novelty and generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what you get ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs015vcg0h88aegdhqtnrxqw))
- Essays are for taking risks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05hjsb07dqabnjwe3c0pk0))
- Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05kbn2kncj0zy4zrfy2tc6))
- I love questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05m9e0zqyegjkt2ek0zc55))
- to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05p4p28k5b3k4ge2vqp2s1))
- What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas. And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already been thoroughly explored. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05s0thtqgn93e6rj7mpvnc))
- To start writing an essay, you need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't generate those systematically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05wkpcf0tct4spt3refc99))
- The quality of the ideas that come out of your head depend on what goes in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs05xb158zab5rp4j5z59smz))
- You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who make you have new ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs060dh13re8ezqtabppggdc))
- While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes from doing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs060sjmdcwfffh6ss4sj35b))
- The way to really learn about some domain is to have to solve problems in it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs062az3rfqeyggx44w7xv43))
- That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas: the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs068cadb9cfn4ajt6bc2bj4))
