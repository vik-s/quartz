## What is a second brain and how does it work?

In today's digital world we are inundated with information in the form of books, articles, podcasts, tweets and so on. If we do not have a way to capture and store snippets of information from this constant barrage of knowledge, there is no way for our brains to recall important snippets of information when it is needed.

Enter "the [[second brain]]", a digital [[commonplace book]], where we capture information and organize it in a meaningful way that enables easy retrieval later. It is a form of [[personal knowledge management]] where we build up a repository of knowledge that is relavant to our interests and pull from it for the rest of our lives.  

In the professional world, [[notetaking]] involves creating notes while viewing them as a knowledge building block. Collect enough of them and reconstruct it in your own way to create something beautiful or important. The length and format of a note does not matter, as long as it is interpreted through your own lens, curated by your tastes, and drawn from your personal experience (this is in direct contrast to [[zettelkasten]] where notes should be as succint as possible [[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow]], [[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]; Forte does bring up the reduction of a note to it's essence later however).

Using a second brain system has the following benefits:
- It helps us declutter out minds by putting thoughts down as notes
- Reveals new associations between ideas (it's not entirely clear how though, as we will see later; in zettelkasten, the links between notes exist to make clear connections)
- Incubate our ideas over time (we tend to choose our most recent ideas and run with it - [[recency bias]]; using old notes might help us discover older but still good ideas)
- Sharpen our perspectives ([[personal knowledge management]] systems gives us a trove of supporting material we can pull from to make a point on any topic)

## The CODE Framework

[[Tiago Forte]] proposes the Capture, Organize, Distill, Express (CODE) framework to implement the second brain system.

- ==Capture==: Whenever something "resonates" with you, capture it in your notetaking system. It is not an analytical decision - identify things that incite, curiousity, pleasure, wonder, or excitement.
- ==Organize==: Save notes by **actionability**, based on your current projects.
- ==Distill==: Reduce the idea to it's key concept, in it's most concise form.
- ==Express==: Use all your capture to create something new.

### CAPTURE

Many highly creative people have a creative process that they rely on. [[Taylor Swift]] writes down snippets of lyrics or music that comes into her mind at random times, and then relies on that to build up her music writing process. [[Jerry Seinfeld]] wrote down all ideas for jokes in a yellow legal pad and filed it away in an accordian folder, and used that to write all his material. The key here lies in capturing what comes across your way so that it can be transformed into somthing useful later.

One pitfall in the capture process is saving too much information. There needs to be some criteria for how to choose what needs to be captured. Broadly, it should have at least some of the following elements: Inspiring, Useful, Personal, Surprising. The recommendation is to ultimately capture what "resonates" - as loose as this term may be. In all cases, *the source of the note* should be captured.

### ORGANIZE - THE PARA FRAMEWORK

The framework to organize notes is based on actionability - "In which project will this be most useful?" - and is based on the PARA System; **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, **Archives**.

- Projects -  These are current projects you are working on, which could include work, personal or side projects. You could put notes related to each project directly into its associated project folder.
- Areas - These are broader "areas" in your life that are not tied to a particular project. They could be things like Health, Finance, Writing, Music, etc. Notes that fall into these areas of interest area stored in its own location, and can be easily pulled from later.
- Resources - These are topics you are interested in, and generally serve no immediate purpose other than your broad interest in them. They serve as a source for research material later on, if you happen to convert these areas of interest into projects.  Some examples are - Notetaking, Nutrition, Music Recording, Habit formation, etc.
- Archives - All things no longer relevant from the previous three areas go here. Projects that are done or abandoned, areas that are no longer relevant, or resources you are no longer interested in.

Whenever you capture a note, ask yourself which of these areas it belongs to, and categorize it appropriately. Notes do not permanently live in any category, they are constantly moving and rearranging depending on how your interests and priorities progress.
