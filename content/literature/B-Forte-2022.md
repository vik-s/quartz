## What is a second brain and how does it work?

In today's digital world we are inundated with information in the form of books, articles, podcasts, tweets and so on. If we do not have a way to capture and store snippets of information from this constant barrage of knowledge, there is no way for our brains to recall important snippets of information when it is needed.

Enter "the [[second brain]]", a digital [[commonplace book]], where we capture information and organize it in a meaningful way that enables easy retrieval later. It is a form of [[personal knowledge management]] where we build up a repository of knowledge that is relavant to our interests and pull from it for the rest of our lives.  

In the professional world, [[notetaking]] involves creating notes while viewing them as a knowledge building block. Collect enough of them and reconstruct it in your own way to create something beautiful or important. The length and format of a note does not matter, as long as it is interpreted through your own lens, curated by your tastes, and drawn from your personal experience (this is in direct contrast to [[zettelkasten]] where notes should be as succint as possible [[permanent/Zettelkasten example workflow]], [[permanent/Using the zettelkasten method to produce written work]]).

Using a second brain system has the following benefits:
- It helps us declutter out minds by putting thoughts down as notes
- Reveals new associations between ideas (it's not entirely clear how though, as we will see later; in zettelkasten, the links between notes exist to make clear connections)
- Incubate our ideas over time (we tend to choose our most recent ideas and run with it - [[recency bias]]; using old notes might help us discover older but still good ideas)
- Sharpen our perspectives ([[personal knowledge management]] systems gives us a trove of supporting material we can pull from to make a point on any topic)

## The CODE Framework

[[Tiago Forte]] proposes the Capture, Organize, Distill, Express (CODE) framework to implement the second brain system.
