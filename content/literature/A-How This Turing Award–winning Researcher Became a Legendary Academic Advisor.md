Manuel Blum is a theoretical computer scientist who won the Turing Award—the Nobel Prize of computer science, in 1995. He is the original creator of the “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” better known as the captcha—a test designed to distinguish humans from bots online. 

What makes him stand apart from his peers is the stunning accomplishments of all his students. Three of Blum’s students have also won Turing Awards; many have received other high honors in theoretical computer science, such as the Gödel Prize and the Knuth Prize; and more than 20 hold professorships at top computer science departments. Blum is also distinguished by the great plurality of subfields that his students work in.

Blum lived in a variety of places that spoke different languages as a child. As a result, he developed some language difficulties. So Blum's 2nd grade teacher warned his mother that he might manage to complete high school, but he might not go to college.

So Blum asked his father - "What can I do to get smarter?". His father answered that if he understood how the brain works, he could be smart. The conversation marked the inception of Blum’s interest in studying consciousness. During his years of education, he took a course on Sigmund Freud and his works, but the answers he got did not satisfy him. His professor told him to talk to Warren S. McCulloch, known for very early research on neural networks and pioneering work in cybernetics. McCulloch took him on in his MIT lab.

Even though McCulloch's lab studied rigorous mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to study neurons and the brain, he still could not study consciousness since the topic was taboo at the time.

When he was at MIT, a branch of computer science called computability theory grabbed his attention, and he started searching for a thesis advisor. He soon found Marvin Minksy, the pioneer of artificial intelligence. Blum received his PhD in 1964.

Blum was completely original in his academic research and did only what he thought was important and he was often right. The question remained - What made him such a great academic advisor? Why were his students so successful?

The real key to his success was making his students believe that their insights were truly valuable, and that they could achieve anything they wanted to.

Blum's advising style is centered around the principle that "Students are here to teach me", and every weekly meeting was exactly that. He really expected to learn from his students every week, and that meant that they had to understand their ideas thoroughly. Blum's advising style was to make his students feel really important and what they were doing is the most amazing thing in the world.

So did he agree with all the ideas that his students came up with? Not really. Blum was known for his terrible memory. If your idea wasn't all that great, he would have forgotten it by the next meeting. He had an incredible ability to mask his inner stressors and remain completely calm to people around him. He was a source of stability for his graduate students.

What would it be like to have someone like Blum in your life, or in the workplace? What inspirational leadership lessons can we learn and deploy to make people around us great?

### Other facts

	In 1999, Carnegie Mellon University succeeded in recruiting Manuel Blum and his wife Lenore Blum, both computer scientists, to join their son, Avrim Blum. They moved into offices next to each other and collaborated on research projects.
