>Life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest

\-Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi 

### What is the role of glucose in the body?

Our body has a need for energy so that it can perform its functions. Regions like the brain have unusual and rather erratic energy needs. The body exclusively relies on glucose for energy.

[[permanent/Glucose is the fundamental means of transporting energy to various parts of the body]] because it is unusally insoluable and can travel well through the blood stream. Think about it as an ideal electron shipping container.

### What is Glycolysis?

[[permanent/Glycolysis is the breaking down of a glucose molecule]]

When glucose reaches the destination cell, the highest energy electrons are stripped and used to construct a carrier module known as NADH  (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide + Hydrogen, or coenzyme 1), in a process called glycolysis. It is the breaking down of glucose (glyco = glucose, lysis = break down).

[[permanent/Glycolysis in the absence of oxygen]]
When glycolysis happens in the absense of oxygen, it is known as fermentation and it produces lactate. This is a stop gap measure for energy production when it is really needed quickly, like during exercise when muscles are pushed to their limit.

### What is Krebs Cycle?


### What is mitochondria and how do they work in the body?

[[permanent/Mitochondria and their structure]]
They are structures believed to have descended from free-floating bacterium that our ancestors injected a long time ago. They do not share the same DNA make-up as humans, but instead they have their own DNA, and co-exist with humans to enable life as we know it.

A mitochondrion is divided into an internal and external chamber by a convoluted border with many folds, which creates a huge surface area. Proteins protrude from this membrane to capture an NADH, then pull its electrons through to the inner chamber, where they finally come to rest in molecules of oxygen.

[[permanent/Mechanism of generation of ATP by mitochondria]]
When an electron is pulled into its internal chamber of the mitochondrion, a proton is expelled to the outer chamber. An electric field is built up between the inner and outer chamber. Each mitochondrion is like an electric battery waiting to discharge. The electric field strength is about 30 million V/m. Its like lightning in a bottle.

The proton is subject to an electric field and wants to get back into the inner chamber where the electric fields are. The only way through is to pass through small conduits shaped like mushrooms. In 1962, scientists discovered that these conduits are like little turbines and the protons turn them as the pass through it. Each turn of the turbine assembles a molecule of Adenosine TriPhosphate, or ATP, which is the fundamental energy currency of the body. It is converted into kinetic, chemical or electrical energy by the body.

>Metabolism achieves something miraculous: through painstaking atomic transformations, it extracts from practically any organic chemical a universal unit of energy, deployable in every corner of every cell, and it does this while wasting nothing.

\- James Somers

As you age, inflammation from a variety of causes such as disease, injury, diet, and stress causes mitochondrial wear and tear. Even just aging seems to cause mitochondria to wear, and that is not yet entirely understood. Old mitochondria are eaten by the body by a process called [[Mitophagy]], and new ones take its place. Aging slows down the replacement rate of mitochondria eventually.

### The Warburg effect

[[permanent/The Warburg Effect is a phenomenon where cancerous cells behave as if they are in a metabolic emergency]], like  during heavy exercise, where there is a shortage of oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis takes over in the cancer cells even when there is plenty of oxygen, and the cells start to ferment building up lactate. This happens universally among all cancers, and the presense of lactate is a common sign of a tumor's presence.

### Link between mitochondrial, aging and cancer

Due to mitochondrial wear and tear, waste products from the mitochondria start to pile up, and the body believes that this is due to a lack of oxygen. It then begins anerobic glycolysis and the cells start to ferment with the buildup of lactate. When glucose arrives, the cell does not strip away high frequency electrons as usual, but instead starts up the process for building more cells, which is one of its earliest directives during embryonic development. As a result, cancerous cells grow in the presence of fermenting cells and lactate, and is a possible explanation of the Warburg effect.
