### Why should we be resistance training?

- If you were to pick one form of exercise, it should be resistance training
- It gives all benefits of cardio in addition to:
	- Muscle and bone strength
		- Osteoporosis (esp for women) is a possibility with age
		- Resistance training makes muscle pull on the bone, and strengthens the bone
		- Weight bearing exercise strengthens bone, not other forms of exercise
		- Cycling, swimming, and other forms of cardio does not help bone density, maybe running is ok to some extent
		- Compound motions like squats, rows, presses, pushups are very helpful for bone density
		- Even >70 yr olds see massive improvements in muscle strength when they start lifting, in 8-12 weeks, even if they have never training before.
			- But always start early. Getting back what you lost is very hard.
			- Always maintain your muscle mass.
			- Women in particular should start early, but its never too late.
			- Early is at least teens and twenties.
			- Create a "bone bank" where you can invest early into bone density. You can stave off bone density loss in old age, but it is better to have a good reserve to start with
		- Resistance training does not stunt growth, this is a myth, there is no evidence for this
		- Even kids 6-8 yrs can start resistance training, and helps with bone density. But they should be supervised, and not get themselves injured. But soccer and basketball are much more prone to injury.
		- There is research to show that 6-8 years old kids can do weight training (look this up).
			- Start with lighter loads
			- Make it enjoyable
	- Posture improvement

### Body recomposition with resistance training

- Any form of exercise (cardio or resistance) isnt always the best way to drop fat mass, but instead you should restrict calorie intake majorly. Exercise is adjunct at that point. 
- Cardio is more for increasing energy expenditure.
- It is important to combine resistance training with calorie restriction to contribute to weight loss. If you do only cardio and no resistance training, you will lose both muscle and fat. No recomposition will happen. Resistance training maintains muscle mass.
- The more weight you have to lose, the easier it is to recomp.
- If you have been training for a long time, then it is harder to recomp. Noob gains is a real thing.
- If you want to bulk up, then you cannot guarantee that you will maximize muscle. You need to be at equal calorie needs or at a slight surplus.

### Nutrition requirements for muscle mass
- Can I have plenty of protein intake while meeting calorie deficit, but not do resistance training?
	- No. You have to do resistance training.
	- but it really depends, maybe if you are very obese then you will lose fat first
	- But even if you are normal, you need a lot of protein to maintain muscle
- Need 1.6-1.8g / kg which is about 2X the RDA. No really downsides, no liver damage, etc.
	- This number is calculated for people who are lean - about 15-20% body fat. If you are obese, then you need to target the lower weight for protein intake calculations.
	- Protein is very diffcult to store as body fat.
	- Older people need even more protein due to reduced anabolism. They need more leucine to kickstart the muscle growth.
- Whole foods are the best for protein intake, but protein shakes are ok if you are not meeting your requirements.
- Dont need leucine supplements if you are taking in animal based protein. They are quality proteins that are rich in leucine.
- 4oz of chicken = 30g of protein
