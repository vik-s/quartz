## Chapter Notes

### Introduction

Newport suggests that the intense work practice of several people in history across multiple disciplines is responsible for their prolific contributions to their field. He attributes their success to what he defines as **Deep Work**, which is defined as:

>[!quote] “Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”

Here are some examples of people who have had a tendency to go into deep focus modes when doing their work:
1. Carl Jung, built a house for himself where he could isolate himself for work
2. Mark Twain wrote in a shed away from the family, who had to blow a horn to alert him for meals
3. Peter Higgs, physicist, was so isolated that people could not find him to tell him he had won the nobel prize
4. Bill Gates stayed in his lakeside cottage for two "Think Weeks" in a year, from where he wrote the famous "Internet Tidal Wave" memo

But we live in a time where distraction is celebrated by being instantly responsive on communication platforms, and in contrast most knowledge workers perform **Shallow Work**, defined as,

>[!quote] “Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”

It appears that the modern world is permanently erasing our ability to perform Deep Work. Instead of nostalgically looking at our distraction-free past, deep work today has more meaning than ever before for two reasons:
1. It is valuable to quickly learn complicated things
2. In the digital age, creating valuable work has incredible reach- more than ever before
In the internet age, more and more people are becoming knowledge workers, and those who have the ability to do deep work, will stand out above the others. This is called the **Deep Work Hypothesis**.
>[!quote] “The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.”

It is notable that deep work does not mean long hours. It is a period of intense focus every for 3-4 hours a day, that is capable of producing valuable output. A deep life is a good life, as Newport says.

### Deep Work is Valuable

In this section, three "successful" people are provided as examples, and the reason for their success is considered. Our future economy looks increasingly *divided* where easy to replicate jobs will be automated away, and hard to replicate jobs will become more valuable. Let's see who these people are and what makes them valuable.
1. Nate Silver- a statistician who took his love of baseball to election predictions
	1. ==A highly skilled worker==, who is capable of taking data and manipulating it with machines to successfully predict new outcomes
2. David Hansson- a programmer who created Ruby on Rails, used a lot to build the internet
	1. ==A superstar whose skillset is clearly at a premium==, and it often makes more economic sense to hire a superstar to get the job done instead of hiring a team of mediocre programmers not capable of that kind of output
	2. Everybody's skill today is traded on a "universal bazaar" where the best will clearly dictate a premium over all others
3. John Doerr- a venture capitalist who fueled many major and successful tech companies
	1. ==A wealthy individual with lots of investable capital==, can fund a company like Instagram which sold for a billion dollars with only 13 people

Not everyone has capital to invest, but the first two are definitely worth looking at. Our interest essentially lies in how we develop the ability to:
1. quickly master hard things
2. produce at an elite level (quality and speed)

The contrary is also important to consider and Newport states:
>[!quote] “If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.”

Both of these skills essentially depends on our ability to do deep work.

To develop the ability to master hard things, we need to have
1. Intense concentration where all our attention is solely focused on overcoming the challenge ahead of us, without distraction
2. Deliberate practice to fail multiple times, use the feedback from the experience and correct your methods till you achieve success
3. Neurological scaffolding called Myelin, which is a fatty tissue that develops around neurons when they are being used to do challenging tasks. Repeated work triggers oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around neurons
