## 02: Choosing a Business Idea

A business idea not have to be life changing. It just needs to solve a pain point for somebody who is willing to pay you for it.

50% of YC startups fail --> there is no perfect formula to find an idea.

2 Part Framework:

##### Align your business with a market that is profitable
- Justin provides a Business Idea Spreadsheet. Use that to push your business idea through the 6 lenses he provides
	- There are 3 profitable markets: Health, Wealth and Relationship
- Colin Dowling says: People buy only 4 things- time, money, sex, or peace of mind. Ask which of these your business provides.

##### 4 question framework
- Look at your practical experience
	- I am a top performing RF engineer which extensive knowledge in academia and industry.
	- I am good at and enjoy writing and teaching.
	- I am good at producing audio and visual media through other (failed) side projects.
	- Example 2: Anthony Natoli
		- Built a course that helps people make more sales
		- Also has coaching classes for 30/60min.
		- In 1 yr he build 6 figure business with 37K LinkedIn followers
	- Example 1: Zach Wilson
		- Runs a 7 figure coaching class about data engineering
- Evaluate learned obsessions
	- I am obsessed about reading technical stuff and trying to make notes out of it
	- I was at least obsessed over finances and retirement
	- Now I am obsessed over running an online business
	- Example 1: Holly the Twister Sister
		- Teaches a Kajabi course on how to make ballon animals (6 figure)
		- Don't ever think your niche is that niche
	- Example 2: Jake Ward
		- Became obsessed with SEO. Bought, improved and sold website.
		- He coaches people in turning a blog into a sales channel
- What do people ask your advice about?
	- It is a good indicator that you have skills / expertise about it.
	- Try thinking of making 15 minute "teardown" videos
	- Example 1: Danny Miranda
		- He made a course about how to interview people on podcasts
	- Can I make a video about how to get an RF engineering job?
	- Example 2: The boring marketer
		- Gives boring marketing advice because people asked him about it
		- He has coaching calls
- What is a problem you have solved for yourself?
	- I was a person who never ever exercised. But now I am an avid health nut. How can I get engineers into being healthy?
	- I figured out how to finish a PhD in < 3 years with tons of publications? I can make an actionable video about how to do this.
	- I got my EB1 visa by designing my own case. Can I teach others to do this?
	- I have started tons of side hobbies while being a full time employee for the last decade. How can I teach people to do this?

##### Market Validation Techniques
This is not always possible to do 100%. You can only get indicators.
Especially hard to do without a big audience. But you can always talk to people.

- Get on to private communities like on slack, or circle or facebook or discord. Join a paid community if you have to.
- Dont sell to them. Just help them out. Hope that you can move them to a zoom call.
- Ask them a reference to other people having the same problem

- Do a 30 for 30 exchange.
	- Find a person in a community and ask them to join a zoom call.
	- Use social media to offer your free conversation call
	- Spend 30 minutes learning about all their challenges
	- Spend 30 minutes of your time to solve their challenges
	- This is both practice and validation
	- Find some questions you want to ask people after a 30-30 exchange
- Social listening
	- What are people saying about your industry?
	- What are people saying about you?
	- Listen to challenges that people have
	- Connect with people who can help

- Use google alerts
	- Put in keywords to scan for challenges in your area of expertise
	- You can get validation, content, people to help
- Use tweetdeck
	- Look for people who are having challenges and provide them with the content you have written around the topic.
	- It is ok to even to reach out and ask for clarity
- Market surveys
	- When can you do this?
		- Survey after newsletter sign up
		- After lead magnet request
		- Attach to social media post
		- Attach to newsletter you write
		- As part of free giveaway
	- Use typeform or google forms or writemessage.com
	- Questions should be simple and clear
	- Most important thing is to survey biggest challenges
	- Use multiple choice but allow them to write free form content
	- This is very important *before* you ever design a course\
	- Here is what you should get out of them
		- Key pain points
		- Preferred solution (coach, course, cohort?)
		- Who are these people? job title? experience? geography?
		- Feedback and suggestions.
	- Group and rank the data
	- The  people you talk to will become your most prospective customers

## 03: Creating your Unique Value Proposition

You need to differentiate your business from others. Customers need to know that *your* product is the right solution for their problem.

Here's the big question : -- **Why you?**  and how you solve the problem

- Build your value statement
	- You help [who] do [what] that lets them [outcome]
	- I help??

Convert your value proposition into pain points:
- RF engineering is black magic, I dont understand how it works
- There is too much math in RF, I'm not smart enough to do it
- I need to prepare for an RF interview and I dont have time
- Books and lectures are hard to read and takes time
- How do I prepare so I can find my dream job

Aspirations after alleviating pain points:
- I really understand RF and its not as hard as I thought
- I find this interesting and want to take it up as a career
- I did so much better in my interview
- I was able to get my dream job in RF

What is my secret sauce? Why me?
- Get specific about the who?
	- Who exactly needs your RF expertise?
- What demographic do you solve?
	- Students? at what level? bachelors? masters?
	- Young professionals with income to spend on bettering their careers
- What interests, values and attitudes do you want to align with?
	- ?
- Does geography matter?
	- No. RF engineering is everywhere.
- What kind of solution are you providing?
	- Affordable? Courses priced at what level at what demographic or income level.
