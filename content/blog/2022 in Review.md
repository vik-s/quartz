Inspired by [this](https://blog.ktz.me/2022-in-review/), I figured I'll make my own list of cool stuff I did in 2022.

- AirBnb in a farm in Ranchita, CA
	- Feeding Kringle the goat was star attraction for the kids
	- Beautiful barn to relax in the quiet evenings
- Borrego Springs Camp

- Ventura Ranch KOA
	- Kids enjoyed the giant bouncy pillow
	- Stayed in a cabin instead of tent
