üì∂ I create electrical models of transistors used in radio communication devices

üéôÔ∏è I co-host a lifestyle podcast - [Half Life Show](https://www.halflife.show)

‚úèÔ∏è I mostly ponder about writing more about radio frequency integrated circuits on my [tech blog](https://rfic.io)

## Health

Over the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based foods when possible. Stretching is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.

## Music

I play in the community rock band at [Villa Musica](https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock). I was a former lead guitarist for [FUSED](https://www.reverbnation.com/fused). I was a founding member of [Black Earth](https://blackearth.in). I've been focusing on alternative and sweep picking techniques to add flurry to my metal lead playing. [Jon Bjork](https://www.jonbjorkmusic.com) has some reallly good tips, and I took lessons for a while with [Straten Marshall](https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall).

## Self-hosting

I host my own cloud storage with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) and my google photos alternative is [Photoprism](https://photoprism.app). I have a home server whose specs I'll list out at some point, but it's fairly simple and low powered. I host a slew of other services too, but maybe more on that later.

## Books

[Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-David-Goggins-audiobook/dp/B07KKP62FW) by David Goggins has had an immense impact on how I think about myself, and what I am capable of. Embracing the hard things in life has definitely had a positive impact on my life. A more detailed reading list is [[here]].

## Podcast list

I am a fairly heavy podcast listener. [[blog/_podcasts|Here]] is my current rotation.
