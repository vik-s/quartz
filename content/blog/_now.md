## Managing time

I try not to get too focused on utilizing every moment of my waking life to any useful purpose. Fulfilling work and family responsibilities is the highest priority, and everything else follows.

I do not use to-do lists. I much prefer daily highlights.

## Health

Over the past year, I have focused on improving health through exercise and nutrition. I weight train 3x per week, and try to incorporate animal-based foods when possible. Stretching is an important part of my evening routine. I usually get at least 7 hours of sleep.

## Music

I play in the community rock band at [[https://villamusica.org/product/adultrock|Villa Musica]]. I was a former lead guitarist for [[https://www.reverbnation.com/fused |FUSED]]. I was a founding member of [[https://blackearth.in|Black Earth]]. I've been focusing on alternative and sweep picking techniques to add flurry to my metal lead playing. [[https://www.jonbjorkmusic.com|Jon Bjork]] has some reallly good tips, and I took lessons for a while with [[https://www.instagram.com/stratenmarshall|Straten Marshall]].

## Self-hosting

I host my own cloud storage with [[https://nextcloud.com|Nextcloud]] and my google photos alternative is [[https://photoprism.app|Photoprism]]. I have a home server whose specs I'll list out at some point, but it's fairly simple and low powered. I host a whole host of other services too, but maybe more on that later.

## Books

[[https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-David-Goggins-audiobook/dp/B07KKP62FW|Can't Hurt Me]] by David Goggins has had an immense impact on how I think about myself, and what I am capable of. Embracing the hard things in life has definitely had a positive impact on my life.
