## Highlights
- The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=97))
- Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them? ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=119))
- What are we missing? It’s simple: a method and a framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting upon the obstacles life throws at us. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=149))
- Great individuals, like great companies, find a way to transform weakness into strength. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=160))
- Like oxygen to a fire, obstacles became fuel for the blaze that was their ambition. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=164))
- “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.” ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=204))
- When you have a goal, obstacles are actually teaching you how to get where you want to go—carving you a path. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=221))
- It’s three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=239))
- Rockefeller had sangfroid: unflappable coolness under pressure. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=266))
- the greater the chaos, the calmer Rockefeller would become, particularly when others around him were either panicked or mad with greed. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=283))
- This insight lives on today in Warren Buffet’s famous adage to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=284))
- Rubin “Hurricane” Carter, a top contender for the middleweight title, at the height of his boxing career in the mid-1960s, was wrongly accused of a horrific crime he did not commit: triple homicide. He went on trial, and a biased, bogus verdict followed: three life sentences. It ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=339))
- Carter declined to surrender the freedoms that were innately his: his attitude, his beliefs, his choices. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=348))
- “Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” as Shakespeare put it. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=374))
- we face things that are not nearly as intimidating, and then we promptly decide we’re screwed. This is how obstacles become obstacles. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=380))
- There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=383))
- Just because your mind tells you that something is awful or evil or unplanned or otherwise negative doesn’t mean you have to agree. Just ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=389))
- When America raced to send the first men into space, they trained the astronauts in one skill more than in any other: the art of not panicking. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=437))
- John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the earth, spent nearly a day in space still keeping his heart rate under a hundred beats per minute. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=452))
- The Greeks had a word for this: apatheia. It’s the kind of calm equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=464))
- Just say: No, thank you. I can’t afford to panic. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=466))
- You can always remind yourself: I am in control, not my emotions. I see what’s really going on here. I’m not going to get excited or upset. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=480))
- No, because I practiced for this situation and I can control myself. Or, No, because I caught myself and I’m able to realize that that doesn’t add anything constructive. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=499))
- The perceiving eye is weak, he wrote; the observing eye is strong. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=508))
- The observing eye sees events, clear of distractions, exaggerations, and misperceptions. The perceiving eye sees “insurmountable obstacles” or “major setbacks” or even just “issues.” It brings its own issues to the fight. The former is helpful, the latter is not. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=510))
- sometimes being superficial—taking things only at first glance—is the most profound approach. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=513))
- The more skilled you become seeing things for what they are, the more perception will work for you rather than against you. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=544))
- Perspective is everything. That is, when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=555))
- Where the head goes, the body follows. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=595))
- Tommy John, one of baseball’s most savvy and durable pitchers, played twenty-six seasons in the majors. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=601))
- Is there a chance? Do I have a shot? Is there something I can do? ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=604))
- If there was a chance, he was ready to take it and make good use of it—ready to give every ounce of effort and energy he had to make it happen. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=605))
- They called it a “dead arm” injury. Game over. John wouldn’t accept that. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=609))
- What are the chances of me coming back after this surgery? One in one hundred. And without it? No chance, they said. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=612))
- we get ourselves so worked up and intimidated because of the overthinking, that if we’d just gotten to work we’d probably be done already. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=681))
- Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=687))
- many people in our lives have preached the need to be realistic or conservative or worse—to not rock the boat. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=723))
- This is an enormous disadvantage when it comes to trying big things. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=723))
- Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=725))
