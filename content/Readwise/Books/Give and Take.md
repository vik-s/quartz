## Highlights
- According to conventional wisdom, highly successful people have three things in common: motivation, ability, and opportunity. If we want to succeed, we need a combination of hard work, talent, and luck
- one that’s critical but often neglected: success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people
- do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?
- two kinds of people who fall at opposite ends of the reciprocity spectrum at work
- Takers have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give. They tilt reciprocity in their own favor, putting their own interests ahead of others’ needs
- giver. In the workplace, givers are a relatively rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them
- If you’re a giver at work, you simply strive to be generous in sharing your time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections with other people who can benefit from them.
- people. If you’re a taker, you help others strategically, when the benefits to you outweigh the personal costs
- Professionally, few of us act purely like givers or takers, adopting a third style instead. We become matchers, striving to preserve an equal balance of giving and getting. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you’re a matcher, you believe in tit for tat, and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors
- Giving, taking, and matching are three fundamental styles of social interaction, but the lines between them aren’t hard and fast
- Research demonstrates that givers sink to the bottom of the success ladder. Across a wide range of important occupations, givers are at a disadvantage: they make others better off but sacrifice their own success in the process.
- Going out of their way to help others prevented them from getting their own work done.
- compared with takers and matchers, givers brought in two and a half times less annual sales revenue
- There’s even evidence that compared with takers, on average, givers earn 14 percent less money, have twice the risk of becoming victims of crimes, and are judged as 22 percent less powerful and dominant
- So if givers are most likely to land at the bottom of the success ladder, who’s at the top—takers or matchers?
- It’s the givers again.
- The worst performers and the best performers are givers; takers and matchers are more likely to land in the middle.
- By operating as a giver, Hornik created value for himself while maximizing opportunities for value to flow outward for the benefit of others.
- These givers reverse the popular plan of succeeding first and giving back later, raising the possibility that those who give first are often best positioned for success later
- I’m going to debunk two common myths about givers by showing you that they’re not necessarily nice, and they’re not necessarily altruistic
- Successful givers recognize that there’s a big difference between taking and receiving
- when givers succeed: it spreads and cascades
- When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses
- As the venture capitalist Randy Komisar remarks, “It’s easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don’t make enemies out there, it’s easier to succeed.”
- In the Oval Office, Lincoln was determined to put the good of the nation above his own ego. When he won the presidency in 1860, he invited the three candidates whom he defeated for the Republican nomination to become his secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, and attorney general
- If politics can be fertile ground for givers, it’s possible that givers can succeed in any job.
- Whether giving is effective, though, depends on the particular kind of exchange in which it’s employed
- In purely zero-sum situations and win-lose interactions, giving rarely pays off
- As Chip Conley, the renowned entrepreneur who founded Joie de Vivre Hotels, explains, “Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a marathon.”
- Conley believes that in today’s connected world, where relationships and reputations are more visible, givers can accelerate their pace.
- As we organize more people into teams, givers have more opportunities to demonstrate their value, as Lincoln did.
- As the service sector continues to expand, more and more people are placing a premium on providers who have established relationships and reputations as givers. Whether your reciprocity style is primarily giver, taker, or matcher, I’m willing to bet that you want your key service providers to be givers
- Why did the giver disadvantage reverse, becoming such a strong advantage?
    - Note: What is to say that the givers were not just more hardworking? For a longr time?
- The fear of being judged as weak or naïve prevents many people from operating like givers at work.
- There’s even evidence that just putting on a business suit and analyzing a Harvard Business School case is enough to significantly reduce the attention that people pay to relationships and the interests of others.
- writes the Cornell economist Robert Frank, that “by encouraging us to expect the worst in others it brings out the worst in us: dreading the role of the chump, we are often loath to heed our nobler instincts.”
