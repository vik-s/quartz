## Highlights
- Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.
- the process of writing starts much, much
  earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument
  is the smallest part of its development.
- This book aims to fill this gap by
  showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into
  convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected
  notes along the way.
- those who take smart
  notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again
- The
  right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even
  years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best
  possible position to write a great paper easily?
- They struggle because they believe, as they are made to
  believe, that writing starts with a blank page.
- good, productive writing is based on good note-taking
- The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends
  more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a
  decision on the topic.
- What does make a
  significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else:
  how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand
- there is no measurable correlation between a high
  IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120.
- self-control and
  self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with
  ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed.
- Not having willpower, but not
  having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.
- A
  good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of
  remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you
  can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and
  you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the
  ideas.
- A good structure enables flow,
- If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself;
  it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push
  yourself and employ willpower.
- The challenge is to structure one’s
  workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that
  push us forward.
- How do you plan for insight, which, by definition,
  cannot be anticipated?
- a
  system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information,
  which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim
  of generating new ideas.
- Dunning-Kruger effect
- high achievers
  who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to
  suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome
- overly
  confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their
  abilities.
- There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have.
  Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway.
- The first idea lies at the heart of
  this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box.
- Even the best tool will not improve your
  productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded
  in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads
  to drive it on.
- as soon as you get used to taking
  smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that you will wonder how you
  were ever able to get anything done before.
- The
  importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s
  “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001)
- And this
  is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if
  you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go
  and let you focus on the task at hand.
- What
  we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a
  successful organization lies in the holistic perspective
- Niklas Luhmann
- he turned note-taking on its head.
  Instead of adding notes to existing categories or the respective texts, he
  wrote them all on small pieces of paper, put a number in the corner and
  collected them in one place: the slip-box.
- He realised that one idea, one
  note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context
  it was taken from.
- I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how
  to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something
  else.”
- We are still so used to
  the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not to believe
  that a simple change in our work routines could not only make us more
  productive, but the work also more fun.
- success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability
  to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments
  that avoid resistance in the first place
- This is
  not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right
  workflow
- if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise
  your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in
  your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just
  can’t be compensated by a high IQ. 
  As
- Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained
  the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main
  one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what
  he read.
- Whenever
  he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of
  a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013,
  170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box
- In
  a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about
  their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the
  main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of
  paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the
  paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of
  the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single
  sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.
- He
  usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the
  slip-box.
- And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with
  great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full
  sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his
  material.
- He then would add
  references
- to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were
  located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were
  directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious
  connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.
- He
  did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a
  transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation
  where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the
  original meaning as truthfully as possible.
- The
  trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather
  abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were
  only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or
  directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or
  addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.
- Whenever
  he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make
  possible connections between them
- The
  last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one
  or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought
  or topic.
- We need a reliable and
  simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of
  our brains
- Make fleeting notes.
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- These
  are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not
  cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox,
  and process them later.
- Make literature notes
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Whenever you read
  something, make notes about the content.
- Keep it very
  short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.
- Be extra selective with
  quotes
- Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place –
  your reference system.
- Make permanent notes
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Now turn to your
  slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day
  and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what
  is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.
- The
  idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions
- Write exactly one note for each idea
- Now add your new permanent notes to the
  slip-box
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does
  not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one
- Adding links to related notes.
- either linking
  to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an
  entry point
- is itself linked to the index.
- Develop your topics, questions and research
  projects bottom up from within the system
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises
  the most insight
- Look through the connections and collect all
  the relevant notes on this topic
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- copy them onto your “desktop”[6]
  and bring them in order.

- Turn your notes into a rough draft.

- If writing is the medium of research
  and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as
  if nothing else counts than writing.
- Even if you decide never to write a
  single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other
  intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than
  writing.
- will make you more engaged
- learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from
  actual good ones
- read in a more
  engaged way
- much more likely that you will remember
- do what you do deliberately
- In
  the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the
  new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it
  again?
- The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system
  organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the
  more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing.
- It can only play out its strengths when
  we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of
  notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled
- Fleeting
  notes
- Permanent notes
- Project notes
- Nothing motivates us more than the experience
  of becoming better at what we do
- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better
  (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being
  praised (which is outwardly rewarding).
- Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks
  tend to occupy our short-term memory
- The brain doesn't distinguish
  between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By
  writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads.
- ego
  depletion
- It is well
  known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks,
- Breaks are
  much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning
- As literature notes are also a
  tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense
  in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just
  jot down some keywords
- Whenever we explore a new,
  unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t
  get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we
  cannot skip. Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a
  difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single
  sentence
- You need to take
  some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so
  you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box
  note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself
- indiscriminate gathering of any relevant
  information regardless of what argument it will support
- The
  slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant
  notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting
  thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw
  conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.
- while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing
  it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as
  ineffectual.
- In
  short: Pure re-viewing just doesn’t make any sense, neither for understanding
  nor for learning
- the best-researched and most successful
  learning method is elaboration
- The objection that it takes
  too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore
  short-sighted
- Not learning from what
  we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of
  time.
- see
  what is not mentioned in the text
- real thinking
  requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing
- A
  common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out
  the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought
- Notes are only as valuable as
  the note and reference networks they are embedded in
- To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable
  collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need.
- Tools
  are only as good as your ability to work with them.
- it is
  indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with
  it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own
  needs
- An idea kept
  private is as good as one you never had.
- underlining sentences or writing comments in the
  margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.
  They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with
  them. If you already know that you will not go back to them, don’t take these
  kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead.
