## Highlights
- Instantaneous access to the world’s knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention.I
- It’s time for us to upgrade our Paleolithic memory. It’s time to acknowledge that we can’t “use our head” to store everything we need to know and to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines
- Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.
- This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas
- your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case
- For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.
- The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.
    - Note: This is different from zettelkasten where a note is meant to be a concise unit of information
- So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom
- Your brain is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful
- This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.
- Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.
- In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges.
- Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.
- Our careers and businesses depend more than ever on our ability to advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it as well.6
  Advocating for a particular point of view isn’t just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material.
- To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express.
- When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.
- The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”
- Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic.
- There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence.
- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.
- Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use.
- This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating
- Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others—by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.
- Creativity depends on a creative process.
- Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts
- Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner’s Approach to Capturing
- It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you
- You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.
- The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital notes is saving too much.
- The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.II
- Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn’t fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.
- As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you’re taking in. This special feeling of “resonance”—like an echo in your soul—is your intuition telling you that something is literally “noteworthy.” You don’t need to figure out exactly why it resonates. Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may skip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly slow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it’s time to hit “save.”
- It’s a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note
- Twyla Tharp’s box reveals the true value of a simple container: it is easy to use, easy to understand, easy to create, and easy to maintain
- We don’t need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works
- the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely.
- Your Second Brain isn’t just a tool—it’s an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they don’t happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. It’s time for us to put more intention into the digital environments where we now spend so many of our waking hours
- Once you’ve created this environment, you’ll know where to go when it’s time to execute or create. You won’t have to sit down and spend half an hour painstakingly gathering together all the materials you need to get started. Your Second Brain is like a mind cathedral that you can step into any time you want to shut out the world and imagine a world of your own.
- As you begin to capture your ideas in a consistent way, you’re likely to experience a new sense of excitement about the information flowing all around you.
  You’ll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you have, and the interviews you listen to, knowing that any interesting idea you encounter can be reliably saved and utilized
- Soon, however, you’ll run head on into a new problem: what to do with all this valuable material you’ve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger this problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and retrieve them only leads to more overwhelm.
- libraries. I tried organizing my files by date, by subject, by kind, and countless other elaborate schemes, but every method I tried soon failed.
  The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away from my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and obsolete
- eventually named this organizing system PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.II
- it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.
- The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: “In which project will this be most useful?” It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.
- dedicated places for each of the main “areas” of your life
- resources,” which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration
- archives” to keep them out of sight but within easy reach.
- Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.
  Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
  Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
  Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.
- Knowing which projects you’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren’t important.
- This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term
- This points to a paradox that a lot of people experience as they take notes: the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, the more time and effort it takes to review it all, and the less time they have to do so
- Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you’ve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project
- The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart
- This is what I call “layer one”—the chunks of text initially captured in my notes
- To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation
- All I have to do is bold the main points within the note
- For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting
- There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words
- recommend using bullet points
- Use your own words,
- With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain
- This is actually a great way to filter down the volume of notes you’re taking—the best stuff always sticks in your mind for an hour or two
- The result points to a mysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so simple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort that was needed to get there
- One of Pablo Picasso’s most famous drawings, created in 1945 and known as Picasso’s Bull, offers a master class in how distillation works
- Ken Burns, the renowned creator of award-winning films like The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz, has said that only a tiny percentage of the raw footage he captures eventually makes it into the final cut
- for every forty to fifty hours of footage he captures, only one hour makes it into the final film
- You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without leaving some points out. You cannot make a highlight reel of a video without cutting some of the footage. You cannot give an effective presentation without leaving out some slides.
- A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer
- When should I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it when you’re getting ready to create something.
- every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII
- If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences
- As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.
- The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.
- The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know
- that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity
- Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make
- Ask yourself: How could you acquire or assemble each of these components, instead of having to make them yourself?
- These are some of the most valuable connections—when an idea crosses the boundaries between subjects
- As powerful as search can be, studies5 have found that in many situations people strongly prefer to navigate their file systems manually, scanning for the information they’re looking for
- there are limitations to what you can find by browsing folders
- often you have no idea where to put it
- each other, making it
- The CODE Method is based on an important aspect of creativity: that it is always a remix of existing parts.
- As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you’ll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible.
- Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble.
- We learn by making concrete things—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going
- You’ll naturally seek venues to show your work
- You’ll read differently
- building. You’ll ask sharper questions,
- You’ll begin to act more deliberately
- You have to value your ideas enough to share them.
- You have to believe that the smallest idea has the
- potential to change people’s lives. If you don’t believe that now, start with the smallest project you can think of to begin to prove to yourself that your ideas can make a difference.
- Chapter
- I saw how rigorous his routines had to be to allow him to pursue his creative calling while raising a family.
- He had a series of what he called his “strategies.” These were habits and tricks that he used to integrate creativity into every aspect of his life and quickly get into a creative state of mind whenever he had time to paint.
- he was collecting, sifting through, reflecting on, and recombining raw material from his daily life so that when it came time to create, he had more than enough raw material to work with.
- We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand
- I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness
- Through the simple acts of capturing ideas, organizing them into groups, distilling the best parts, and assembling them together to create value for others, we are practicing the basic moves of knowledge work in such a way that we can improve on them over time
- Our notes are things to use, not just things to collect.
- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work
- To create an Archipelago of Ideas, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense
- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining—laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together
- Instead of starting with scarcity, start with abundance—the abundance of interesting insights you’ve collected in your Second Brain.
- the “Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story.
- launchpad for the next step in your progress.
- next steps
- current status
- any details
- your intention
- Share this Intermediate Packet with a friend, family member, colleague, or collaborator
- Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important. By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.
- Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost—only saved for later use—gives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I’ve wasted effort or that I’ll lose the results of my thinking forever
- sharing before I feel ready has completely altered the trajectory of my career.
- Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time
- Start by picking one project you want to move forward on
- Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for the project. Start by writing out anything already on your mind, and then peruse your PARA categories for related notes and Intermediate Packets.
- Move all the notes and IPs you might want to use into a new project folder.
- Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the notes you’ve gathered in front of you
- If you find that you can’t complete the first iteration in one sitting, start by building a Hemingway Bridge to the next time you can work on it.
- you feel resistance to continuing with this project later, try Dialing Down the Scope
- Throughout every step of this process, be sure to keep notes on anything you learn or discover, or any new Intermediate Packets you might want to seek out.
- Once you’re finished with your first iteration, have gathered feedback, and collected a new set of notes to work with, you’ll be ready for whatever comes next
- There is a certain level of organization that you want to maintain in your digital world, so that when you go there to get things done, your virtual workspaces support your productivity instead of interfering with it
