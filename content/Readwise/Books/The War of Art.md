## Highlights
- How many pages have I produced? I don’t care. Are they any good? I don’t even think about it. All that matters is I’ve put in my time and hit it with all I’ve got. All that counts is that, for this day, for this session, I have overcome Resistance.
- There’s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don’t, and the secret is this: It’s not the writing part that’s hard. What’s hard is sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.
- Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.
- Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet
- It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be.
- it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius.
- Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront Resistance?
- Does Resistance have to cripple and disfigure our lives before we wake up to its existence?
- Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt
- Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.
- Resistance is the enemy within.
- Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work
