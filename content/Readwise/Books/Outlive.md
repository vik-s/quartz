## Highlights
- exercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life
- even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years
- It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan
- if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exercise
- if exercise is not a part of your life at the moment, you are not alone—77 percent of the US population is like you
- Going from zero weekly exercise to just ninety minutes per week can reduce your risk of dying from all causes by 14 percent
- regular exercisers live as much as a decade longer than sedentary people
- The data on exercise tell us, with great clarity, that the more we do, the better off we will be
- cardiorespiratory or aerobic fitness. This means how efficiently your body can deliver oxygen to your muscles, and how efficiently your muscles can extract that oxygen, enabling you to run (or walk) or cycle or swim long distances.
- peak aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness, measured in terms of VO2 max, is perhaps the single most powerful marker for longevity
- VO2 max represents the maximum rate at which a person can utilize oxygen

- VO2 max is typically expressed in terms of the volume of oxygen a person can use, per kilogram of body weight, per minute. An average forty-five-year-old man will have a VO2 max around 40 ml/kg/min, while an elite endurance athlete will likely score in the high 60s and above
- The higher someone’s VO2 max, the more oxygen they can consume to make ATP, and the faster they can ride or run—in short, the more they can do.
- poor cardiorespiratory fitness carries a greater relative risk of death than smoking
- having a higher VO2 max is better for your overall health and longevity than having a lower VO2 max.
- The fitter you are, the lower your risk of death. Again, there is no other intervention, drug or otherwise, that can rival this magnitude of benefit. Exercise is so effective against diseases of aging—the Horsemen—that it has often been compared to medicine.
- When we are exercising, our muscles generate molecules known as cytokines that send signals to other parts of our bodies, helping to strengthen our immune system and stimulate the growth of new muscle and stronger bones.
- Endurance exercise such as running or cycling helps generate another potent molecule called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, that improves the health and function of the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays an essential role in memory.
- exercise is even more effective at preserving healthspan than extending lifespan.
- One of the prime hallmarks of aging is that our physical capacity erodes.
- fat-free mass (meaning mostly muscle mass) and activity levels remain relatively consistent as people age from their twenties and thirties into middle age. But both physical activity levels and muscle mass decline steeply after about age sixty-five, and then even more steeply after about seventy-five. It’s as if people just fall off a cliff sometime in their mid-seventies.
- By age eighty, the average person will have lost eight kilograms of muscle, or about eighteen pounds, from their peak
- Continued muscle loss and inactivity literally puts our lives at risk
- Your exoskeleton (muscle) is what keeps your actual skeleton (bones) upright and intact.
- falls are by far the leading cause of accidental deaths in those ages sixty-five and older—and this is without even counting the people who die three or six or twelve months after their nonfatal but still serious fall pushed them into a long and painful decline.
- Just as with VO2 max, it is important to maintain muscle mass at all costs.
- the more effort you’re willing to put in now, the more benefit you’ll reap in the future.
- This is why I place such an emphasis on weight training—and doing it now, no matter your age
- I will find a way to lift heavy weights in some way, shape, or form four times per week, no matter what else I am doing or where I might be traveling.
