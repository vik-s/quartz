## Highlights
- At first, I tried to make my blog the go-to resource for high-level gameplay information, breaking down team compositions, winning strategies, and little tricks to give gamers a competitive edge. But over time, I started to realize it wasn’t the informative stuff that made the front page—it was drama.
- More importantly, they wanted to know what some of the best players were like in real life.
- Watching Ming execute this strategy perfectly, I began to mirror my writing style off his. Every one of his posts was a blend between informative content and controversy-inducing tangents.
- Everything changed for me when I started incorporating more of my real life into my writing.
- it was missing the most important piece of the puzzle: there was no social component, no way for readers to explore and discover new, interesting writers. And without this discovery feature, the likelihood of someone coming across my blog was slim to none.
- The most popular answers, the ones with the most views, upvotes, and comments, weren’t “answers,” as much as they were stories
- I didn’t need to be an “expert” to answer those types of questions.
  I just needed to share my story.
- Every single question on Quora was a creative writing prompt.
- For an entire year straight, I challenged myself to write one Quora answer, every single day.
    - Note: The key to everything awesome is consistency
- My first Quora answer received a whopping 37 views.
- Now, this is where most people would have given up
- Unphased by my first answer’s performance, I pressed on.
- I had learned that day at work and using it as inspiration for my writing on Quora.
- I tried to think about exactly when I had learned the answer to each question, what had happened, what was said to me, when it had “clicked,” and then shared that.
- The more answers I wrote, the more I learned what topics were resonating with the most people, and the more I started to realize what people really enjoyed about my writing.
- when I wrote about niche topics, viewership was mediocre
- But when I wrote about universal life lessons, my writing went viral.
- January, 2015, I landed on the front page of Reddit.
- That’s when I launched www.nicolascole.com
- Knowing I had a limited window of time to capitalize, I spent that entire weekend putting together a personal website.
  Not because I wanted to start writing there—but because I now had a product to sell.
- wrote two eBooks: one with all my favorite workout routines, and another with my exact meal plan
- I stuck with my habit of writing an answer per day, every day—and even though I never wrote another answer quite as viral as that one, consistency is what kept me growing, growing, growing.
- My writing career was about to take off.
  “We expect our paid columnists to write at least four articles per month,” the editor said.
  Feeling like I’d been playing in the minor leagues and was being offered a contract to play in the NHL, I said, “Can I write thirty?”
- Now, most people in my position would have stopped writing on Quora, graduating to writing for a major publication. I didn’t.
- I had built a massive following on Quora, and was averaging more than 1.5 million organic views per month, every month, while still having at least one of my answers republished by a major publication every single week. I was on fire, and wasn’t about to throw all my hard work to the wayside.
- Instead, I doubled-down on my daily writing habit, and committed to writing one answer on Quora, and one article for Inc Magazine, every single day.
- I needed to play a more profitable game.
  On accident, I discovered the world of executive ghostwriting.
- I’d “beaten the game” of online writing.
  Now, I needed to figure out how I was going to turn all that attention into a full-time income. 
  It was humbling for me to have spent four years on a book, only to release it into the world and sell a couple hundred copies (I couldn’t exactly “live” off $82.76 per month in royalties).
- By writing online, you elevate yourself. And when you elevate yourself, you open new doors of opportunity.
  It took me a long time to realize that writing online isn’t just for writers.
- 1. The definition of a blog.
- The entire purpose of starting a blog, and having people come to your own site, is for two reasons and two reasons only—and both are inspired by money. First, you either plan on monetizing your website via ads (which is why it’s so crucial that people read your material on your site, which you own), or second, you plan on using your blog to attract a certain type of customer to your website in order to capture their email address and/or sell them a product, service, etc.
- But making money from your writing is not the same thing as 1) starting a website monetized through ads (which is a media business) or 2) starting a website that sells a product or service (which could be anything from a physical product to an information product like an online course), which are all different variations of an e-commerce business.
- Either way, when you start a “blog,” you aren’t really in the business of writing.
  You’re in the business of ads, products, or services.
- For the vast majority of people, the primary purpose of having a website is to quickly communicate who you are, what you do, and what you have done in the past.
- In short, it’s a business card.
- you’re
- 3. The definition of Online Writing.
- The way I define Online Writing is based on one variable and one variable only:
  Sharing thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights on a platform that already has an active audience.
- If you are writing on your own platform hoping an audience will come to you, that’s Blogging.
- And if you are bringing your voice to a platform where an audience already exists, that’s Online Writing.
- The reason I am so wholeheartedly against blogging as a writing strategy is because starting a blog means starting a new website, and starting a new website means starting with zero traffic.
- And how do you get traffic to your blog?
- Spend money on ads
- Optimize your blog posts for Search Engine Optimization
- Build a social media following on another platform
- But here’s the thing: none of the above have anything to do with sharing your thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights at scale
- So
- There are two scenarios where starting with a blog is actually the right decision.
- The first scenario is if you are a business selling some sort of product or service, and revenue is the primary outcome you are looking to drive.
- Your blog should become an industry publication, where the purpose of that publication is to tap into search traffic around specific keywords and increase the likelihood of a reader becoming a customer looking to buy your product or service.
- The second scenario for starting a blog is the solopreneur, the digital marketer, the fitness coach, the individual who is less concerned with sharing his or her own individual insights and perspectives, and instead wants to use writing as a marketing mechanism for their internet business
- Hubspot, for example
- One of the best examples I’ve ever seen is a website called Kindlepreneur.
- Kindlepreneur with Dave Chesson
- In this sense, Dave’s blog has almost nothing to do with sharing and scaling his own thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights, and is more centered around building a brand and “ultimate encyclopedia” of knowledge for anything related to one singular topic: self-publishing
- If you are a company with the resources to build and scale your website into an industry publication, you should start a
- blog. And if you are a solopreneur who wants to “own” a category or niche by creating a directory of knowledge, you should start a blog. But if you don’t fit within either of these two categories, then blogging is not your best path forward.
- Now, there is a third scenario where you can be a successful “blogger.” However, it is an outlier scenario, and not one I would recommend. Maybe five or ten years ago. But not anymore.
  The example that comes to mind here is Mark Manson.
- The reason I say Manson’s approach is outdated is because newer, better tools have been created in the past ten years that make the process of building your name, audience, and credibility as a writer exponentially faster.
- Do you want to build a company and brand, making money selling ads, products, and/or services? Then a website and “blog” makes sense. But if you enjoy writing and want to build a personal brand, position yourself as an authentic voice in your industry, and share your thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights at scale, then do not start a blog.
- Data is the single greatest indicator of what’s working (and what isn’t working) about your writing.
- There are 2 types of writers today: those who use data to inform and improve their writing, and those who fail.
- why would a writer wait until the moment they were ready to publish their product to start building their audience? The more logical path forward would be to start writing online, build an audience, learn what people actually wanted from you, and THEN launch your product.
- The new way to think about being a writer in the digital age is to turn your writing into a data mining machine.
- 99% of people think they know what they should write about.
- the brutal truth is, they don’t
- before you do anything, before you write your book, before you launch your product, before you think about “positioning yourself,” you need to write online.
  Why
- Writing online, first, reduces your risk
- Writing online, first, helps you find your voice
- Writing online, first, builds your audience from day one
- Writing online, first, will give you insight into what people want:
- All of a sudden, I was no longer making decisions based on what I thought people wanted.
  People told me what they wanted—all I had to do was listen.
- This is your “Writing Data Flywheel.”
  Your “Writing Data Flywheel” is a mechanism for endless inspiration
- The sooner you start receiving feedback on your writing, the faster you will grow as a writer
- Likes = “This is something I approve of. Nice job.”
- Shares = “This is something more people need to know about. This represents me.
- Comments = “This is thought provoking. I agree/disagree, and I want you to know why.
- Views = “This strikes a chord. There’s something valuable here.”
- Practicing in public is how you gather that data in the first place.
- I believe the only way to overcome this fear is to run directly at it.
- The answer is because they’re afraid.
- Now, why don’t people like this approach?
- And it’s in running directly at it that you become the person “worth listening to” in the first place.
- Writing online is a competition, plain and simple.

  How The Online Writing Game Works: 7 Levels Of Success
- Unfortunately, most people don’t see the internet this way. Instead, their measure for success is more binary. If they write a blog post, they’ve succeeded. If they don’t write a blog post, they’ve failed
- And because their measures for success are so black and white, they tend to spend money on all the wrong things to drive exposure, increase their audience, and build their credibility: a better-looking website, a bigger advertising budget, more PR, more promotions, more, more, more.
- Their biggest problem is the writing itself.
- Level 1: Conscious vs Unconscious
- Successful writers play the game of Online Writing consciously. Unsuccessful writers play the game unconsciously—and then wonder why they aren’t succeeding.
- I’m telling you that by playing the game with intention, and paying attention to the data, you will discover and amplify your most authentic writing voice ten times faster.
- Choose A Category
- Most people have no idea what category they’re actually writing in.
- the ENTIRE—art and business and “game” of online writing is rooted in understanding what category you’re actually competing within. Unless you can consciously name the category, you will never have a firm grasp as to whether your work is “Better” or “Worse” than the competition
- Categories are how we organize information in our minds. Know your category and you’ll know where readers “fit” you into their own minds.
- Your job is to take the time to read, observe, and study your chosen category to the point where you understand its native language. You should be able to hear the nuances in how people communicate
- Level 3: Define Your “Style” (Where Do You Sit On The Writing Spectrum?)
- this.
- Educating <<<>>> Entertaining
- Creating a unique, memorable, and “different” writing style is nothing more than a deliberate choice to sit somewhere unexpected on this Writing Spectrum
- The more unexpected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to stand out.
- On the other hand, the more expected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to sound like everyone else—and blend into the noise.
- The secret to creating a unique writing style is by doing what
- would be considered “unexpected” in your chosen category
- I cannot
- My recommendation would be for you to get started writing, publishing, gathering data, “practicing in public,” and studying The Ladder of your chosen category
- Level 4: Optimize Your Writing Style For Speed
- If your story is reliant on the reader making it past the first few pages, then chances are, your story doesn’t need those pages.”
- I would just start with the main point instead
- The Rate of Revelation.
- This is the rate at which you reveal new information to the reader
- Level 5: Specificity Is The Secret
- The inverse rule of “Specificity is the Secret,” is “The Broader You Are, The More Confusing You Are.”
- Ineffective writing is nothing more than writing that does not resonate. And the reason it doesn’t resonate is almost always a reflection of specificity—or lack thereof
- A lot of aspiring writers shy away from naming their writing that specifically, because
- they
- But especially when you’re first starting out online, a box is exactly what you want. You want people to know where to put you on the bookshelf in their mind.
- For example:
  “Marketing” is broad. “Content Marketing” is more specific.
  “Content Marketing” is still too broad. “Content Marketing For High-Growth Businesses” is more specific.
  “Content Marketing For High-Growth Businesses” is still too broad. “Content Marketing For Founders And Executives Of High-Growth Businesses” is more specific.
    - Note: Justin welsh has exactly the same example On his website
- Either this is going to be exactly what they’re looking for, or they’re going to know right away I’m not the right writer for them
- the more specific I am, the more I as a writer also gain clarity around what it is I’m actually writing about
- Marketing is a great way to build exposure,” is a broad statement. “Content marketing is a great way to build exposure for your business” is more specific.
  “Content marketing is a great way to build exposure for your business,” is still a broad statement. “Content marketing
- the more specific you can be, the more likely you are to resonate with your target reader MORE than your competition.
- The real question you should never stop asking yourself is, “Could this be more specific?” Because
- Start
- Level 6: Engineering Credibility
- Luckily, how you build credibility on the internet is easy. In the simplest way, signals of credibility are nothing more than subtle (or not-so-subtle) signs that you know what you’re talking about and are “worth” listening to.
- The first layer is Implied Credibility
- Implied Credibility is how much “Better” or “Worse” your content is than everyone else’s in your chosen category
- Your content is so good, your credibility is implied.
- The second layer is Perceived Credibility.
- Profile picture
- Bio
- Production quality
- Grammar
- Organization of thought
- Specificity
- What credible people have to say about your writing
- Which major publications your writing has appeared in
- How many followers you have on social media
- High barrier-to-entry products
- Badges and achievements
- How much money you’ve made from your craft
- What so many people fail to realize is that these signals can also backfire—and they backfire often.
- you skip straight to this step in the game (and so, so, so many people do), chances are, every person whose attention you capture is going to be disappointed. They’re going to know, within the first three paragraphs of reading your writing, whether or not they’ve been tricked
- You might have captured their attention—but you certainly didn’t keep it.
- The third layer is Earned Credibility.
- This is the most undervalued form of credibility on the internet.
  It’s also the easiest to acquire.
- the reason we choose to pay attention to some people and choose not to pay attention to other people is not because of Perceived Credibility
- It’s actually their Implied Credibility (quality of content) and Earned Credibility (proof they’re “playing and winning the game”).
- What hooks us is their consistency, their improvement over time, and most importantly, their ability to create something that resonates with us in that particular category.
- long you’ve been creating content for
- How often you create content
- How much content you’ve created
- How many people consume your content
- How well one of your pieces of content has performed
- something uniquely different that comes with these badges, in the sense that each is a reflection of effort, skill, and self-discipline.
- What makes a badge of credibility valuable isn’t really the badge itself. It’s how the writer chooses to wear it.
- The moment you have even one signal of Earned Credibility, you should start leveraging it
- If one of your articles gets 10,000 views, you should have a link in your bio saying, “Read my most-popular article with more than 10,000 views.”
- Level 7: Create Your Own Category
- Competing in other people’s categories sucks.
- The answer is to create a new category of your own.
- Pop Science
- Gladwell, instead of competing in either of these two categories, created his own—which the media has since referred to as “Pop Science.” His books are based on thorough research, but they’re written for a non-academic audience.
- No-Bullshit Self-Help
- but it wasn’t until Jen Sincero published You Are A Badass, and Mark Manson published The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck, that a whole new niche emerged: telling people how to un-fuck their lives, plain and simple
- Fratire
- Before Tucker Max’s, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell, there was “satire,” and there were fraternity stories told around bonfires while drinking Natty Light
- The real reason Max became a #1 New York Times best-selling author was because he had created a completely new category
- Do I want to keep trying to be a ‘Better’ version of someone else? Or is it time I become a new and DIFFERENT version of myself?”
  And DIFFERENT always beats “Better.”
- Categories are created at unlikely intersections, spotted by writers with an intimate understanding of one or multiple sub-categories
- The fact that my top 10 highest-performing articles are predominantly about personal development should tell you something. These weren’t articles about me—these were articles about you, the reader. These were pieces to get you thinking, to make you more productive, to help your life in some way. And it was because I was putting the reader first that my articles performed so well. Anytime I shifted the focus to myself, or leaned too heavily into my own “navel gazing,” viewership fell.
- Trying to become a popular YouTuber today is much more difficult than it was 10 years ago. We’re seeing the same thing happen in 2020 with podcasts on Apple and Spotify. It’s much harder to start a popular podcast today than it was five years ago
- Phase 1: New website or platform is invented—early audiences flock
- Phase 2: Website or platform starts gaining traction—early users become “influencers
- Phase 3: Website or platform is established and begins a decade-long journey to profitability
- Whenever I look for new platforms to leverage as a writer, this is the “window” I look for. Because this “window” provides maximum upside for content creators
- The reason is because as soon as a platform reaches this stage, it needs to achieve certain exposure and engagement metrics in order to warrant turning on its advertising machine
- What these social platforms then do is begin prioritizing their high-volume and high-engagement content creators, giving them more and more exposure in user feeds—because they want to ensure engagement metrics remain high. In addition, because there isn’t any advertising on the site or in-feed yet, there is dramatically less friction between you and the people who follow you.
- Phase 4: Advertising model is launched and user reach starts falling.
- As soon as advertising begins on a platform, you can expect your reach to fall
- When a platform monetizes with ads, what happens is they have to start picking and choosing which content to show users in their feeds
- Without ads, you might have seen 20 potential pieces of content in the three minutes you spent scrolling. But with ads, you might only see 15 pieces of content, with 5 ads sprinkled in. Well, where did the other 5 pieces of content go? They’re still somewhere on the site, they’re just not being prioritized—which means those content creators are getting less views.
  This is what’s known as “throttling.
- Substack is aiming to be the “social” writing platform for paid newsletters. The reason I say “social” is because, unlike true social platforms where the purpose is to browse and scroll, Substack actually operates much closer to a tool for writers rather than a social environment (in the sense that there isn’t an algorithmic feed where you can consume new content, follow writers, etc.). However, the fact that they allow users to loosely browse newsletter creators tells me the social component of their site will develop over time.
- This means some very smart people are betting on the growth of the category of “paid newsletters” for writers and media creators.
- Deciding to start writing online is one thing.
  Not giving up is entirely another.
  The unfortunate reality is that most of us suffer from “instant gratification syndrome
- There is no such thing as, “I wrote my first piece and received 10 million views.” If that’s your expectation, get it out of your head now.
- Writing online requires an unrelenting commitment to consistency.
- If your goal is to be a successful writer, then social platforms are for publishing first, and consuming second.
- I have a rule I live by, and it goes like this:
  “The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.”
- You don’t become a writer by reading other writers. 
  You become a writer by writing—a lot.
- The more you write, the more data you will accumulate, the better your skills will get, the faster you will learn
- Stage 1: Just Start Writing
- Stage 2: Write Consistently For 6 Months And Then Make A Decision
- Part of getting started writing online means acknowledging that whatever it is you publish today will not be the single greatest thing you ever write. In fact, if it was, I’d make the argument you have an even worse problem on your hands. Instead of getting better over time, you’re going to get worse.
- The writers who become successful aren’t necessarily the most talented writers.
  The writers who become successful are the most consistent writers.
- It’s impossible to know whether or not you have something meaningful
- to say, or if a platform is worth writing on, unless you give yourself six months to find out
- Goal #1: See whether or not you can be consistent.
- The minimum amount you should be writing and publishing new material online is once per month. That is the absolute minimum
- My true “recommended minimum” however is to publish something once every other week.
- In order to be taken seriously on the internet as an authority in your category and a leader in your industry, niche, or genre, you need to be writing and publishing new material 2x
- per month
- And if you really want to beat the game of capturing and keeping attention, if you truly want the most guaranteed path to success, then you need to be writing and publishing something new several times per week—or ideally, every single day.
- First, think of a social media algorithm as a roulette wheel
- Every time you create a new piece of content, you are pushing that content into the social platform’s algorithm and “spinning the wheel.”
- Second, readers are fickle. So are viewers, listeners, and consumers of any type of content
- If my favorite content creator stops playing the game, I’m not going to sit around and wait for them to come back
- For this reason alone, you have to understand that in order to be “seen” as a credible, consistent source of information, you need to prove to audience members you’re going to be there for them and with them, day in and day out.
- Third, you have no idea which one of your creations is going to be “the one” that takes off
- Goal #2: Start gathering data about what your most popular categories are.
- your first six months of writing online, you should be less concerned with “establishing” yourself and more focused on “discovering” yourself.
- The way we would engineer this process for our clients at Digital Press is we would come up with three categories (“Content Buckets”) that represented who they were and what they wanted to write about.
- We would then begin writing and publishing content in all three of these different categories, alternating back and forth until we started to see patterns emerge.
- We were running an experiment. And what we usually found was, the topics they thought people would want to hear about from them weren’t actually the topics data told us were most engaging
- Once data enters the equation, this is where the “Who Do I Want To Be?” conversation gets interesting. Do you want to keep writing what you had originally wanted to write about? Or do you want to write what people clearly want more of?
- My answer is: you should always do both
- Data doesn’t lie. But data is also a reflection of the external crowd, and not necessarily your internal compass
- Let data tell you your next move, give people exactly what they want, and win the game.
    - Note: Option 1
- ignore the data
    - Note: Option 2
- there is a third option, and that’s to optimize the former so you can introduce people to the latter.
- Goal #3: Pay close attention to writers at the top of the hierarchy of the social platform—and constantly measure yourself against their performance.
- If you want to surpass even the most popular, highest-performing writers within an existing category, all you have to do is everything they’re doing, more consistently.
- Your job is to study the competition and understand exactly why they are succeeding in the first place.
- Question everything. Nothing a creator does repeatedly is accidental.
- These unspoken “rules of the game” exist on every single platform
- Your job is to find the common threads, make them part of your own strategy, and then slowly over time create a style and category of your own
- Stage 3: Once You’ve Proven You Can Be Consistent, Pour Some Gasoline On Your Fire And Go KABOOM!
- If
- However, if you’re unable to be consistent for six months, if you’re incapable (no matter how hard you try) to write on a regular basis, I have some bad news for you:
  You’re not a writer.
- So, if you can’t be consistent for six months, either realize you love the idea of being seen as a writer more than you love sitting down and writing and move on to something else, OR, try again.
  Pinpoint your mistakes.
  Be honest about why you weren’t able to remain consistent.
- Consistent output is the secret to every growth metric on the internet: Views, Comments, Likes, Shares, etc.
- Audience Hacking means collaborating with another writer who has a similar audience to you—introducing your audience to them and their audience to you
- Once you have a sound foundation as a consistent writer on the internet, now you can begin adding in all the fun growth strategies that start to separate amateur writers from professional writers.
- Audience Hacking
- Collaborations could include:
  Co-authoring an article together
  You interviewing them, and them interviewing you
  You sharing one of their articles, them sharing one of your articles
  You both meeting up in real life, taking a picture or shooting a short video clip together, posting it and tagging each other
  You giving them a testimonial, and them giving you a testimonial
- It’s an incredibly effective way to market yourself to new audiences while at the same time creating content that is different and maybe even better than what you could otherwise create on your own.
- Trend Jacking
- Trend Jacking is probably the easiest, most common growth hack on the internet.
- Trend Jacking is where you hop on someone else’s train in order to bring some of that heightened attention back to yourself.
- Engagement Hacking
- This growth tactic can be very tedious, but it works extremely well.
- Engagement Hacking is where you engage with the audiences of other writers, introducing them to your own writing.
- The first step is to make a list of other writers within your chosen category
- Once you have a list of ten or fifteen writers (ideally with audiences similar and slightly larger than your own), go to each of their profiles and start commenting on recent content they’ve published—or, even better, respond to someone else’s comment on their content
- The whole idea here is to get your name in front of the same people who are actively looking for the type of content you write
- Hashtag Stacking
- Most people don’t know how hashtags actually work.
- The biggest mistake people make when using hashtags is treating them as words and phrases within their actual message
- you are writing or sharing links to your writing on platforms that use hashtags, the correct way to do hashtag stacking is to do a little research before you post—so you can tag your content with popular, relevant folders. First, go back to your list of popular writers within your chosen category. What hashtags are they using? Why are they using them?
- The second step is to then create different tiers of folders for your posts to be organized within. When you click on a hashtag on any social platform, you can see how many people are currently using that hashtag. What you want to do is tag your posts with a blend of both large, popular hashtags and smaller, niche hashtags
- The reason I like tagging posts with both broad and niche hashtags is because it gives each post a chance to be exposed to the masses, and to be found by highly targeted readers
- entire secret to getting exposure on your writing online is to find as many ways as possible to make your writing resonate both on a broad level and with a specific audience at the same time
- Publishing Hacking
- One of the biggest benefits to building a vast library of content for yourself is the fact that you can continue to leverage that library over and over again.
- The bigger you build your library of content, especially when your content is more timeless than timely, the more you can continue to engage your audience well into the future. There’s nothing wrong with sharing an article you wrote three years ago—especially if it’s a great article.
- Delete your original post, change a variable or two, and publish it again.
- Maybe you published it during an unlucky time of day. Maybe your original title didn’t have the right hook. Maybe you realized after the fact that your post could have been flushed out further. Whatever the reason, there are no rules against deleting your original post and republishing it with a different set of variables
- My personal advice is to avoid publishing and deleting content as often as possible
- Instead, I’m a big believer in just re-writing a new and improved version and publishing a second piece instead
- Build syndication relationships with websites and major publications, and get around the “duplicate content” rule
- 100,000 views, I thought it wasn’t a winner. Then it got syndicated by Business Insider and it went crazy. Which is why it’s to your advantage to have your content appear in as many places as possible on the internet. You never know which environment is going to be the one that makes it “go.”
- However, the “con” of this strategy is what’s known as “duplicate content.”
- Duplicate content” is the terminology Google uses to explain their ranking system—and their dislike for seeing the same exact content on multiple websites.
- The only time you should be worrying about duplicate content (which means: the same exact content appearing on multiple, different websites) is if you are writing with a heavy focus on SEO
- In short: writers who fear “duplicate content” think they’re doing the right thing, not realizing they’re actually playing a completely different game
- The beginner version of this strategy is to post every single article you write on every single social platform you can
- Every time I write an answer on Quora, for example, I will copy/paste that answer, give it a headline, and also publish it on Medium. Then
- I’ll take that Medium article, copy/paste it, and publish it on LinkedIn. And I’ll keep doing this with as many social platforms as I can, where publishing articles of that quality is acceptable.
- The advanced version of this strategy is to reach out to websites and publications and let them know you are writing content that aligns with their target audience, and that you’d be willing to let them syndicate your content for free
- The expert version of this strategy is the advanced version at the publication level.
- There are five types of writing on the internet.
  Form #1: Actionable Guide
  Form #2: Opinion
  Form #3: Curated List
  Form #4: Story
  Form #5: Credible Talking Head
- The way you “win” the game of online writing is by creating the single best possible version of whatever form of writing you’re using in your chosen category.
- The very first question you should ask is, “What type of writing is this?”
- The second question you should ask is, “How can I make this the ULTIMATE guide to writing online?”
- Your goal should be to create a guide so specific, so comprehensive, so informative, that the moment a reader starts reading what you’ve written, they will immediately 1) bookmark it, 2) share it with someone else, and 3) feel as though they don’t need to go read any other guides, articles, or eBooks on the same topic.
- This requires research. It’s nearly impossible to know whether or not you’ve successfully “beaten” the competition if you have no idea who your competition is in the first place. So, poke around the internet. Google the topic you want to write about, along with a handful of related topics. Read a few other people’s “ultimate guides,” and see if you can pinpoint where they went wrong, or where you (as the reader) wished they had gone more in depth.
- the third question you need to ask yourself is, “Can I make this more specific? Am I trying to cram too much into one article?”
- You aren’t aiming for a word count. What you’re aiming for is the most value you can possibly deliver WITHOUT 1) confusing the reader, or 2) wasting their time.
- The usual mistake writers make here is they try to fit too many ideas into one single piece of content.
