## Highlights
- Our strength, more than any other thing we possess, still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies.
- A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong.
- The part of the rep that causes most of the soreness is the eccentric, or “negative,” phase of the contraction, where the muscle is lengthening under the load rather than shortening.
- Exercise methods that produce very high levels of soreness as a constant feature of the program – due to random exercise selection that precludes adaptation to the stress – can contribute to long-term systemic inflammation, the kind that produces poor health instead of fitness and strength
- Soreness is an unavoidable part of training, but it should not be sought after as a primary objective and worn as a badge of honor for its own sake.
- It is extremely important to develop the ability to distinguish between injury pain and normal soreness, since your health and long-term progress depend on it.
- Humans are not physically normal in the absence of hard physical effort
- Exercise is not a thing we do to fix a problem – it is a thing we must do anyway, a thing without which there will always be problems.
