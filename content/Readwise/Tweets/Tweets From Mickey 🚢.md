## Highlights
- **I’ve posted on X for 115 days straight with a 9-5.**
  Without sacrificing family time.
  Here’s 3 simple steps on how you can do the same by combining the strategies of my 3 favourite creators:
  ‣​ Dan Koe
  ‣​ Kieran Drew
  ‣​ Justin Welsh
  **–––––––––––––––**
  **Step 1: Figure out how much time you have (Dan Koe)**
  *If you are limited for time, where should the majority of your energy and attention be going?*
  My health, 9-5 and family responsibilities means I have a maximum of 20 hours a week to manoeuvre the right tasks towards achieving my goals.
  The tasks are:
  ‣ Curiosity & research
  ‣ Publish 3 tweets a day
  ‣ Daily engagement to build a network
  Now we’ve covered the tasks, let’s turn our attention to focused work.
  When time is scarce, distractions are an abundant luxury we cannot afford.
  On the days I work from home I set aside:
  ‣ 2-3 hours in the morning before my son is up
  ‣ ~90 mins after my son is asleep in the evening.
  My AM blocks are focused on writing and my PM blocks are focused on researching and learning.
  *Where can you find the time to work around your 9-5 & responsibilities?*
  A word of caution.
  Your schedule will break unless you have a content system. 
  Which brings us to the next step...
  **–––––––––––––––**
  **Step 2: Systemise Content Creation (Kieran Drew)**
  Content systems help you to save time.
  My schedule fell apart multiple times because I was writing from inspiration. I’d spend way too long trying to create content.
  When time and inspiration dried up, I felt stuck.
  If you don’t have a content system you risk overrunning on your time blocks.
  Here’s how I fixed this problem using Kieran’s Magnetic Writing System.
  To attract people into my world, I focused on:
  ‣ Personality (entertainment)
  ‣ Advice (education)
  ‣ Stories (inspiration)
  Every Thursday morning I write 21 short form posts. It takes me ~2 hours. That’s 3 posts for each content pillar per day.
  Through the week, I’ll make a note of ideas and place them in one of these buckets. When Thursday morning arrives, I know exactly what to write.
  To help solve my problem of keeping within the time constraints I introduced editing sessions. For the short form posts, I’ll edit them for 30 mins for two consecutive days.
  As a result, my content become much clearer and started to resonate. Last week was my best week for growth and engagement.
  To save time in future, I started to capture my best performing posts and created a hall of fame.
  My criteria for selecting the top performers is simple:
  ‣ Top posts by likes (primary)
  ‣ Top posts by reach (secondary)
  This is how you can build up weeks of content as you develop your hall of fame and repurpose the content from different perspectives.
  I use a checklist which is adapted over time. The checklist is a list of prompts that helps me to repurpose the high performing post. Examples below:
  ‣ Can you turn it into a story?
  ‣ Can you turn it into a listicle?
  ‣ Can you turn it into a unique platitude?
  It gets better.
  I love Kieran’s idea of having a writing SOP. 
  This a set of written instructions that describes the step-by-step process to be taken to properly perform a routine. When time is limited and you have to execute, thinking about what you need to do next impacts the time spent on doing it.
  It’s a document I’ve started and adapt as I improve my workflows to support content creation. It’s been a great tool to solve procrastination.
  Now that you have a system for creating content, how can you save more time so that you can start building authority with more in-depth content?
  Here comes the good part.
  **–––––––––––––––**
  **Step 3: Create your own high performing templates (Justin Welsh)**
  An idea I love from Justin is to use ChatGPT to create templates from high performing posts.
  Here’s an example of a post that did well:
  https://t.co/hte1UA4L6t
  Here’s an example of a framework I can now use in future with the help of ChatGPT:
  *[Preferred Activity 1]*
  *[Preferred Activity 2]*
  *[Enjoyable Aspect 1]*
  *[Enjoyable Aspect 2]*
  *[High Income Skill]*
  *"The life of a [Descriptor] [Type of Person]."*
  (Note: the key here is not to take the output for verbatim, but to adapt it to your content topics).
  How easy was that? And it only takes a few minutes!
  I realised with a system in place I had more time. So I challenged myself to start writing 2 long form posts per week.
  Here’s how we can maximise our time with long forms.
  **–––––––––––––––**
  **Bonus Step:**
  For long form posts, I expand on short form ideas that have performed well. I may also share something I have learned that can help my audience too.
  There was a new task here to add here in my schedule: idea development.
  I recommend outlining the long forms before focused writing blocks. Then use the research blocks in the week to start building the body for long form posts. 
  If you can get a week ahead, everything you consume will help towards generating ideas for the long forms and therefore, reduce your time writing them.
  My long form outlines are written on a Saturday so when Monday morning arrives the following week, I know exactly what to write.
  There’s a lesson here:
  Get good at networking and systemising short form creation before introducing long forms.
  **–––––––––––––––**
  I hope I’ve given you some inspiration on how you can structure your day when you have other responsibilities.
  You’re human, I know how tough it is.
  Start slow, systemise and then add on tasks to keep moving forward as you get better and quicker at completing them.
  If you’re like me here’s a schedule of what’s working well:
  **Total time ~ 20 hours a week**
