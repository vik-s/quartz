## Highlights
- The simple, 5-step social media funnel I've used to generate $6.74M+ in revenue: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696521237217708))
    - Note: Save
- 1. Start at the end
  What will you be selling?
  - A service
  - A product
  - A community
  - Whatever you sell
  Choose your preferred outcome and we'll start with the end in mind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696543844516206))
- 2. Choose your sales vehicle
  How will you promote it?
  - A blog
  - A podcast 
  - A newsletter issue
  - A YouTube video
  This will act as the vehicle that you use to 'sell' your product or service. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696566124716197))
- 3. Design the vehicle
  You'll need to write, record, or video about something related to your product.
  Start by highlighting a narrow problem that your product solves.
  Something smaller, that when solved, opens up a larger problem.
  One your product solves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696588551577841))
- 4. Create your passive 'sales' pitch
  Inside of the article (or video) will be natural opportunities for you to mention your product.
  You don't have to aggressively sell.
  You can simply link back and mention how it solves the larger problem opened by solving the narrow problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696611750253036))
- 5. Create your social post
  Lastly, you'll move to the top of funnel.
  You need a social post to drive people to your vehicle.
  Pull out nuggets from the article or video that would make great X, LinkedIn, or YouTube content.
  Then? Link to the vehicle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696633967550487))
- When you're done, you have this simple funnel:
  Social post
  ↓
  Sales vehicle
  ↓
  Sales pitch (CTA)
  ↓
  Product landing page
  Then, it just becomes a game of constant funnel improvement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696656306372773))
- How you improve the funnel:
  - More impressions (better social)
  - Longer read/watch time (better vehicle)
  - More views to landing page (better CTA)
  - More revenue (better landing page)
  Over time, this becomes predictable.
  The best part? Content works while you're not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1769696678758498660))
