## Highlights
- “*Boringmarketer, Justin Welsh mentioned you in his new course, Creator MBA!*”
  Huge! The fact that he mentioned me as a creator to check out means a lot.
  His content is super actionable and he clearly practices what he preaches (building to $5m!)
  When I got this text, I decided to spend a few hours analyzing his site’s SEO.
  And coming up with some SEO ideas for Justin and his audience:
  <a href="https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh">@thejustinwelsh</a> often talks about being a “diversified solopreneur”, which he truly is.
  If you look at his SEO stats you’d be amazed:
  ***In the last couple of years, he has grown to***
  - 6000 monthly visitors (just from organic search)
  - earned 6.4k backlinks
  - currently ranking for 105 keywords in the top 10
  - traffic from 146 countries
  - DR 65
  which is pretty awesome, to say the least!

  **The mistake made by most creators:**
  I see most creators only tapping into social channels.
  They fail to see the immense potential in SEO and organic search.
  The truth is that SEO is a low-hanging fruit for most creators (like Justin).
  As a creator, you already have
  - social signals
  - personal brand
  - amazing products
  So, why not take it up a notch by investing in SEO?

  ***Simple SEO ideas for creators like Justin:***
  **1. Share thought leadership articles**
  You are a creator, you already have the content, an audience, and a voice as a thought leader.
  So, use this to post blog articles on your website.
  - Pick one of your top-performing pieces of social media content
  - Repurpose that into a blog article (you can use AI for this)
  - Do some basic keyword research—look for the main topic of the post on keyword research tools like Ahrefs Keyword Generator (it’s free) or AlsoAsked. You’ll find a bunch of related long-tail keywords to optimize your post for.
  - Optimize your post’s title, headings, meta descriptions, images, etc, for these keywords. And hit publish.
  Bonus tip: It’s OK to give away your secret sauce. Doing this will build trust & credibility. You can choose only to share the “what” and the “why”, instead of the “how.”
  **2. Repurpose your newsletter**
  If you have a newsletter (which you must), you can publish it on your website as additional articles.
  This will help you share additional content that is valuable to your audience and also drive organic traffic.
  **3. Talk about your competition**
  Optimize your site for discovery keywords like “best product design courses”
  And create a listicle where you list down your competitors.
  And showcase your course.
  This will help you tap into the traffic from your competitors.
  **4. Leverage communities like LinkedIn, Reddit, Quora**
  Get active on these platforms, create content, and talk about your courses.
  Divert traffic from these platforms to your website.
  This is a great way to piggyback on these platforms’ traffic (parasite SEO), especially when you are just starting out.
  **5. Get on YouTube**
  YouTube is the second largest search engine.
  And YouTube SEO is easier to crack compared to Google.
  There are plenty of ways you can repurpose content and put it on YouTube to get more traction.
  **6. Create + promote lead magnets**
  Whether it is blog traffic or social media following, you should be getting these people into your email list.
  You can do this by creating and promoting freebies like free email courses, checklists, Loom tutorials, cheat sheets, ebooks, etc.
  Create simple landing pages for these lead magnets.
  Add links to these in your social media bios.
  Promote them as content upgrades on your blog.
  **7. Get some links**
  Go out and write guest posts for your friends' sites, as a creator you probably are part of various communities. 
  See how you can collaborate to improve your domain authority.

  And those were some of my top SEO tips for creators.
  As I mentioned above, SEO is low-hanging fruit for most creators who already have newsletter content, social media following, and brand awareness – and want to be diversified!
  So, try these tips out and you’ll soon start seeing good results.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFL5mPQXUAAjEMV.png'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFL5xAYXgAAFam4.png'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFL6lSJWgAAC57N.jpg'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFL6ru9WQAEtyH3.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/boringmarketer/status/1752739820344881441))
