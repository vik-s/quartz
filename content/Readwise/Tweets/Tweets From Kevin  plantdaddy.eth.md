## Highlights
- Lotta new faces here thanks to [myfirstmilpod](https://twitter.com/myfirstmilpod) - here's my abridged entrepreneurship journey:
  **Poker "Pro":** Went to college @ UCSB, played online poker to pay for school. Was decent, not amazing. Probably cleared $250k which paid for school + a nest egg post graduation.
  **Web Design & SEO Agency:** After college, designed WordPress websites for local clients. Barely paid bills. Got into SEO and added that on as a service. Paid bills slightly better, but not amazing.
  **Blogging: **At the same time, I was trying to grow blogs of my own. The first one ever was a blog on cocoa butter cream skincare products (LMFAO) and I earned my first $1 via that blog from Amazon Affiliates.
  A switch flipped inside my head as now my time wasn't perfectly coupled to earning income. I consider this the true "Matrix unplug" moment for me.
  **Kendrick Lamar Fan Site: **Helped my cousin [JonStenstrom](https://twitter.com/JonStenstrom) run the #1 Kendrick Lamar fansite that he bought for $4,000. This was well before Kendrick's *good kid, m.A.A.d city* album dropped. 
  Kendrick's manager called us thanking us for putting him on blast 24/7 on our blog. But after the album dropped and rocketed up the charts, all of a sudden we were not seen as friendly figures. We shut the site down, but not before making ~$40,000 in ad revenue + merch sales.
  **Microgreen Farming: **My love for gardening had already blossomed by this point, and I learned of tiny produce called "microgreens." I grew some, loved the look and flavor, and immediately hit the fanciest street in San Diego to try to sell to restaurants.
  Every single one said no except the last (and best) restaurant on the street, and for 6-9mo I ran a "grown to order" high-end microgreen business for some of the best restaurants in the city. Shut it down because I wanted to travel.
  **Relationship Improvement App: **I cofounded a startup called GreatMate with [iamdchuk](https://twitter.com/iamdchuk) and we raised a bit of cash. The idea was simple: there are a lot of apps that help you get INTO a relationship, but few that helped you stay in one + improve it.
  We were using machine learning algo's in 2014-2015 to try and infer music, gift, restaurant, etc. ideas for your significant other based on their existing interests, then we'd recommend a variety of those clustered around your important dates: birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's day, etc. 
  The idea was that we'd make a small piece on the referral to the transaction, basically affiliate marketing / lead gen wrapped in a cool app. The app WAS cool, but we built desktop-first which probably wasn't the right move and I believe were a bit early. Plenty of other things went wrong that I attribute to my own failings.
  **Book in a Box / Scribe Media: **After GreatMate shut down, I decided to work at a startup to figure out why everything I built hit a certain ceiling of success. I was the 2nd employee at Scribe Media, then run by [TuckerMax](https://twitter.com/TuckerMax) and [zachobront](https://twitter.com/zachobront) and now headed up by [EricJorgenson](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson). 
  This wasn't really part of an entrepreneurial journey as I was working at a company, but it was a formative time for me as I learned to question all of my assumptions about business building. I left about 18 months later to focus on [epicgardening](https://twitter.com/epicgardening).
  **Epic Gardening: **This is the business I run today as Founder / CEO. It's grown from a small blog I founded in the early days of my journey to the world's most-followed gardening brand across all major media platforms.
  In 2019, 3 years after going full-time on the business, I'd tripled revenue every single year. From $18k -> $72k -> $225k, and then $550k in 2019 with the addition of physical products.
  As a gardening creator, companies wanted to put their products in front of my audience 24/7, so I asked myself, "Why don't I put MY product in front of MY audience?"
  After launching products, revenue increased from $550k to $2.8mm from 2019-2020, and $2.8mm to $7.3mm from 2020-2021. All on a team of me + 4 contractors - a garden helper, assistant, video editor, and writer.
  At the tail end of 2021, I raised money from The Chernin Group to further grow Epic into the company that I believe it can be - a generational gardening brand that helps teach the entire world to grow food.
  Today, Epic Gardening does well over 8 figures in revenue and has made multiple acquisitions - a seed tray company, another blog, and [BotanicalSeeds](https://twitter.com/BotanicalSeeds) which are carried in the majority of all independent garden centers & nurseries in the country.
  **Real Estate Ventures**
  Due to selling physical product, I was working with a 3rd party logistics company to help me fulfill my product, and was paying a TON of money to them for pick and pack fees, storage, etc. I asked myself, "Why would I pay all these fees when I can buy a warehouse, operate it myself and build equity in the building while being my own tenant?"
  So that's what I did. I formed a new entity, bought 2 warehouse condos in San Diego, rented one, and operated out of the other. It was a LEARNING experience. There is a reason you work with 3PLs when you're an ecommerce operator.
  After raising money for [epicgardening](https://twitter.com/epicgardening), I decided to sell the warehouse as we were moving our fulfillment to a new location. The proceeds from that sale ended up being able to purchase a 20-unit multifamily complex, which I operate separately.
  **Bitcoin Mining: **I've been interested in the crypto space since 2013 when I received my first fractional Bitcoin. Never as a major % of my portfolio, but I crunched some numbers and they indicated that mining Bitcoin, so long as the price remained above a certain threshhold, was more cost-effective than buying it. 
  So that's what I did. I own and operate Bitcoin miners that are using energy that would otherwise go uncaptured.
  There are about ~20 more ventures that I tried and failed that aren't even included in this breakdown, but wanted to write this out to encourage those thinking about building something that it *is possible* no matter who you are. 
  I don't have some crazy pedigree or background. In fact, my Dad died in an accident when I was 13, a lot of my family shunned my mother after that which was very traumatic, and my Mom has had a debilitating chronic illness for over 35 years. I basically had to figure most things out myself from age 13 onwards.
  What I did have was an insatiable burn to DO SOMETHING and the curiosity and bullheadedness to just KEEP TRYING STUFF. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KevinEspiritu/status/1768418426123633017))
