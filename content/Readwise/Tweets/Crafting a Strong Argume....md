## Highlights
- Crafting a strong argument is crucial for any research paper.
  But many academics struggle with with.
  Here's how AI can help you sharpen and polish your argument (prompts included): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729825454188597500))
    - Note: Save
- 1. First of all, you'd need to have your argument written down in as much detail as possible. 
  It doesn't matter how basic or unrefined the argument is.
  For example, here is a paper that I am working on with a very basic argument. But it's good enough to seek feedback on. <video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825546735882240/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/51zUJhBBmY6HC-m9.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825546735882240/pu/pl/EvP9vwUPCpT0nGLN.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825546735882240/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/UOUdJHmC2ZRheM_x.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825546735882240/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/43lsbGL7EFc6IpZL.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729825710141849976))
- 2. Choose one or two authors whose works you have closely engaged with. You may have built on their work or critiqued their arguments.
  Take the papers that you have engaged with and upload them to ChatGPT or Claude.
  For this thread, I am using Cluade 2 â€” Anthropic's latest model â€” through Poe.
  Poe gives you access to a bunch of LLMs including GPT-4, Claude 2, and many others.
  Please note Poe requires a paid subscription.<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825928736362496/pu/pl/aeYYjzd2pXKAJCXS.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825928736362496/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/deRYNSdfdJKynNbP.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825928736362496/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/5zHDOZDp8zPiQYsy.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729825928736362496/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/-VOOiIJ32bH4eOqt.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729825951012306954))
- 3. Upload the papers with the following prompt:
  This is a paper by [author name]. Please go through it and keep in mind its text. You don't have to do anything further.
  You can upload multiple papers in one go, or do it one by one like I am doing here. <video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826022533513216/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/V5YbZPEXAH-Z3wi4.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826022533513216/pu/pl/IApwCRL4HHgeypPx.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826022533513216/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/CSvFfhEv0lPsnJ8m.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826022533513216/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/-e8oLlrJVRDFCKDl.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729826082143027241))
- 4. Next, upload your own draft to Claude (or ChatGPT) and use the following prompt:
  This is one of my own papers. I develop the idea of [your central idea] in this paper. How would [author name] critique my argument?
  Mention the name of the author whose paper you uploaded earlier.
  Claude (or ChatGPT) will give you a list of possible criticisms. Read them closely and rewrite your argument in light of this feedback.<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826160094154752/pu/pl/cgBqLeQiSpgJ4OUl.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826160094154752/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/xk7DgE4KV1Ub9vif.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826160094154752/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/bdcRNoZdwAegnz9y.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826160094154752/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/CGwa1QnkMvnJrwVi.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729826233041494265))

- 5. You can also ask AI to help you counter those criticisms.
  Use the following prompt:
  I want to counter [author name]'s critique. How should I go about it?
  You will get a list of suggetions. Now you can use them to polish your argument.
  You can do this whole procedure 2-3 times with different authors and you will get a decently crafted argument.<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826422632443904/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/bI8PX4WN7K-xYw7D.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826422632443904/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/M5KUUdEPH2AaZYHS.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826422632443904/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/wJ3YjgayiMtALizY.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729826422632443904/pu/pl/DgjAWSeEqaDnzzhF.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1729826456069447934))
