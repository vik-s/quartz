## Highlights
- Hard pill to swallow:
  You’ll never be a good entrepreneur if you can’t solve problems at your job.
  7 reframes you NEED as an employee if you want to become an owner: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261201353421078))
    - Note: Save
- Solutions, Not Complaints
  Anyone can complain about what's wrong - leaders brainstorm how to make it right.
  When you highlight a problem, ALWAYS have potential solutions ready.
  Reduce others' work to a simple 'yes' or 'no' exercise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261205912522773))
- Open Eyes Pounding Heart
  Most live with a constant state of dread.
  "It's going TOO good, it won't continue."
  "It's crashing, we're going to fail." 
  Motivate upwards instead. You’ll be surprised at the glass ceilings you shatter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261211612639377))
- Crab Bucket Effect
  Crabs in a bucket pull each other down trying to escape.
  It's the same at your job:
  Instead of obsessing about others' success, ask what YOU can do to win.
  Then help others do the same. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261215286894779))
- Self-Serving Asks Backfire
  When you ask for a raise, frame it like this:
  • I will make the company 25% more
  • If I can do that, I'd like an X% cut of it
  Re-frame demands to align with others' incentives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261218940133403))
- The Open Ledger
  Almost every business owner has a ledger somewhere with one thing... 
  All the money people never paid them back (and probably never will). 
  Find & solve evergreen problems like this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261222538838461))
- Give Credit, Take Blame
  Highlight team wins, even if you drove them.
  Own failures, even if others caused them.
  You'll forgo short-term pleasure for an unassailable long-term reputation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261226020085900))
- Treat Yourself like an Asset
  Become too valuable to live without.
  Ask questions. Shadow pros across the company. Take on new responsibilities.
  Become the person your manager negotiates with vs the other way round. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1722261229790699694))
- Everything changes after you're an owner.
  But these are 7 steps to take to get there.
