## Highlights
- Imagine this: *You're launching a course in one month - and want it to sell for $10,000+ in the first week - what would you do?*
  **Here's the exact game plan I'd use to get it done (again)**
  *Today:* The only thing you have is the idea, the outline, no newsletter subscribers, but some followers here on X.
  **Step 1: Launch a hyper-specific newsletter.**
  It doesn’t matter who your target audience is; if you only talk to them on social media, you are doing 5x the work for less return.
  You need a mailing list to keep in touch with those genuinely interested in the topic you talk about.
  People launch newsletters without a goal in mind. They might have some idea that they are going to grow it to 10,000 subscribers to sell ads, but there’s no clear goal or timeline.
  *Launch a (short-term) newsletter about the same topic/problem your course is about:*
  🌶️ How to launch a local newsletter
  🌶️ How to get more SaaS customers
  🌶️ How to grow your newsletter with content
  Ste**p 2: Define the 5 steps
  Yo**ur course (and your newsletter) now offers a solution to one Big Problem.
  Next step is to divide that up into parts. 
  Imagine where your audience are right now, and what they need to do to get to where they want to be (i.e. solve the Big Problem).
  This can be 5 steps, 5 parts, or 5 things they need to learn.
  For* the course on how to grow your newsletter with content, it could look like this:
  🌶*️ Define your audience and their Big Problem
  🌶️ List 5 main topics to talk about
  🌶️ Create an email course as a lead magnet
  🌶️ Write one post from each of the 5 main topics each week
  🌶️ Link the lead magnet in the most popular posts
  Think ab*out them as puzzle pieces - the steps they need to take, in that specific order, to solve their Big Problem.
  Step 3*. **Craft a very targeted, clear sign-up page
  Most n**ewsletter landing pages are too vague.
  The perf*ect page has 4 things: 
  🌶️ Wh*o it is for (Your very specific niche)
  🌶️ Where they are now (The Big Problem)
  🌶️ Where they want to be (Describing what life will be like when the Big Problem is solved)
  🌶️ How you will help them get there (The exact resources/content you will give them in the newsletter)
  Step 4. Post** every day about the 5 Steps.
  Social med**ia are much better than a newsletter on one point; attracting new eyes!
  Create a well-written, value-packed, actionable post every day about one of the 5 steps.
  Circling between all of those steps, will attract leads no matter where on their journey they are.
  Add the link to your newsletter in as many posts as you can - without it being pushy or too much.
  Step 5. Send** one or two updates every week to the newsletter
  Share the **most liked social media post from last week to your newsletter.
  Don’t worry about re-using content; most of your subscribers didn’t see it.
  If you have the band-width, send a second email each week with unique content.
  At the end o*f each email, add an update from the course:
  🌶️ Screens*hots
  🌶️ Short video
  🌶️ Table of content
  🌶️ Loom video of yourself
  Step 6. Create a** 3-day email challenge
  Define what the** very first step towards solving The Big Problem is.
  Look at the first of the 5 steps.
  For the Grow with Content course, it is finding the Big Problem.
  Write a 3-day email sequence, where you help your audience do exactly that.
  This is your lead magnet.
  About 10-14 days before you launch the course, start promoting the challenge.
  Post about it once per day.
  Step 7. Write yo**ur sales pitch
  A course is no**t sold in one email. 
  My go-to sequence is 7 emails, looking something like this:
  1. Explain the problem and how it affects them (Where they are now)
  2. Help them imagine what life would be when the Big Problem is solved (where they want to be)
  3. Explain the steps to take to solve the Big Problem (The 5 Steps and help them get a quick win)
  4. Show how you are the right person to help them (Reviews, case studies, testimonial, etc)
  5. Present the Course as a shortcut to solve the problem
  6. Share a case study on how someone (or you) used the techniques in the course to get a big win.
  7. Remind them to buy the course
  Step 8. Launch t**he Challenge and Sales Pitch
  Schedule the c**hallenge to end the day before you launch the Sales Pitch. 
  3 Day Challenge *→ 7 email sales pitch = 10 days.
  Send the Chall*enge to those who signed up for it. 
  Send the 7-day pitch to those on your newsletter and those signed up for the challenge. 
  ---
  That was a lot. This is a handful when you create it the first time. 
  But when you have one version done, you can re-use it for new courses.

- **This is the most common newsletter "strategy" (and it sucks):**
  • Top-off-funnel content on social media 
  ↓ 
  • Plug the general newsletter landing page 
  ↓ 
  • Send Top-of-funnel content to the newsletter
  It is better than not having a newsletter at all. *But you could increase your revenue tenfold* by having a strategy:
  **✔️ Build your mailing list as a Modular Newsletter **
  Instead of one single path leading to one goal, each part (lead magnets, welcome sequences, sales sequences) does one thing. 
  There can be several of each, connected in different ways. 
  It makes it much easier to improve and change.
  **✔️ Post Top, Middle, and Bottom funnel content on social media. **
  Most creators and entrepreneurs focus only on top-of-the-funnel content, which will speak to the most people. 
  But this will only give you attention and a bigger reach. It won’t drive potential customers towards working with you. Balance it with MOFU and BOFU content.
  **✔️ Use several lead magnets targeting different problems and sections of your audience. **
  Segmented and targeted sales sequences often return 200% - 300% more revenue than a general email blast. 
  Having several different lead magnets or landing pages gives you more opportunities to market your newsletter without getting pushy, as it aligns with different content topics.
  **✔️ Have several different sales flows going off automatically**
  Depending on who, when, and where they signed up. 
  When using a Modular Newsletter system, it becomes incredibly easy to deliver more value to each individual on your list.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFpX1fYXAAAVaVM.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JensLennartsson/status/1754812666084732944))
