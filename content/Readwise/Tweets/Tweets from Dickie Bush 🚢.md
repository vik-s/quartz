- I flew more last year than in my prior 10 years combined.
  8 lessons & realizations on airports & flying:
  1. **When in an airport, never sit & never scroll.** Take a walk, do some stretching, stay moving, etc. You’re about to sit & scroll for multiple hours in a row once you’re on the plane.
  2.** Board in Group 1, no matter your group.** 99% of the time they don't say anything. Worst case they tell you to wait, then you're first when they call your actual group.
  3. **Never buy the WiFi.** It's the only time in the last month you haven't had access to the internet. Use time to think/write/read/let your mind wander. 
  4.** Economy class is like a public bus in the sky. **It’s worth it to upgrade, not for what you get, but for what you don’t have to deal with. It’s also proven you cannot think big picture about your business unless you’re in business class. Will not explain.
  5.** Never check a bag. **Their are zero incentives for the service crew to 1) take care of your bag 2) make sure it gets to its destination. Carry-on only.
  6. **Make a note in your phone called "airplane journal." **Write a quick entry any time you're in the air. Talk about life, where you're going, who you're seeing, how you're feeling. You'll look back in 10 years thrilled you logged all your travels.
  7. **TSA Pre is a laughably underpriced service. **$100 to save you dozens of hours every year for 5 years. I actually cannot believe some people don’t have this. If you still take your shoes off at the airport… nvm.
  8. **Download your favorite albums & most impactful podcasts to Spotify.** Listen to the albums in order as the artist intended. Relisten to the podcasts and you’ll pick up on some ideas you missed the first time around.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GDFQTWcX0AABZUl.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1743263416817471934))

- The solution is to find something you love doing, wake up far before you have to go to your 9-5, and work on it.
  Most people hate to hear that as the answer, but it’s the truth.
  When I was working on Wall Street I woke up at 4:30 AM damn near every day for 2 years to write for 2 hours before getting to my desk at 7 AM.
  It’s a fallacy to think “once I quit my job, then I’ll find something to look forward to working on.”
  You have to find that thing, pursue it with intensity that others would find unreasonable, and keep doing that every day until it no longer makes financial sense for you to keep your full-time job. 
  This is what worked for me brother. 
  Hope it helps ✊ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1749218065454092421))

- How I’m generating 20 writing ideas every morning in under 5 minutes — without any “additional” work:
  I call this “**Calendar Mining.**” 
  Here’s how it works in 3 steps:
  **Step 1**: Every morning when I sit down to write, I pop open my calendar.
  **Step 2:** I scan each and every entry from the day before and the day ahead.
  **Step 3:** For each entry, I think about what I could share that would be:
  • Useful to me (meaning I gain something from writing about it)
  • Useful to one reader (meaning someone would benefit from reading it)
  For example, just yesterday, in my calendar I had:
  • An in-person podcast
  • Two hours of lifting & yoga
  • Two hours of employee 1:1s
  • My morning priming routine
  • My morning mobility routine
  • Each of my meals mapped out
  • My end-of-day reflection process
  • This writing brainstorming session
  • Time to FaceTime with my girlfriend
  • A scheduled block to listen to an audiobook
  • Time for reading & winding down to end the day
  Each of these “blocks” is ripe with potential frameworks, lessons, and breakdowns that I’m *already doing *but just need to formalize and write up.
  As a result, I’m in my best writing flow state in years—for 3 reasons:
  **Reason #1: This guarantees the writing is useful to me**
  This takes away the downside from any time invested in writing.
  Worst case, zero people read it but I better distill something for myself, which is a win.
  The lens here is, “Would I write about this if no one could read it?”
  If the answer is yes, I should write about it no matter what.
  **Reason #2: This guarantees the writing is written from a 1st-person perspective**
  The most memorable ideas are always supported by a personal story or example.
  And this writing style ensures I can pair the framework with something that will help the reader remember it in the future.
  **Reason #3: It’s helping me test new topics I could potentially expand in the future**
  Many of the recent ideas I’ve written about have been personal systems that I’ve used for years.
  And since I’ve used them for years, they’ve become extremely obvious to me.
  And since they’re extremely obvious to me… I assume other people would find them obvious as well.
  But just after a few days of writing about things I haven’t written too much about in the past (my fitness routines, my approach to employee 1:1s, thoughts on travel, etc.) I’ve found this isn’t the case.
  And as a result, I have several new content buckets I can expand on in the future.
  **Reason #4: This unlocks a much simpler writing style because I’m just saying what happened rather than trying to teach anything**
  This helps me frame the writing as “here’s what I’m doing” rather than “here’s what you should do.”
  It’s like I’m having a conversation with someone who asked me about the topic. I’m just answering their questions.
  *Now, to get "meta" for a second…*
  I’m literally practicing what I preach as I write this entire piece.
  • It’s written in the first person
  • This is an example from my calendar
  • It’s written in a conversational writing style
  • I’m giving you tangible examples that give context to the framework
  Worst case, no one reads it (but I better understand my own framework).
  Best case, someone finds it valuable, tries it in their own life, and shares it with their friends in the future.
  And since you my dear reader are reading this sentence right now, you are that someone.
  And on and on my writing flywheel spins.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEdDClvXAAARvYL.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1749440720492957915))
