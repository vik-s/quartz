## Highlights
- Making $1 on the internet changes your entire mindset around building income online.
  Once you realize you can make $1, you know you can make $10. If you can make $10, you can make $1,000.
  And it's easier than you think.
  Here's how to make your first $1 online (in 4 steps):
  Step 1: Talk to people to understand their common problems
  Step 2: Grow a small audience around solving that problem
  Step 3: Build a small email list of interested people
  Step 4: Use the easiest, cheapest, most familiar tech stack
  Let's break them down further:
  Step 1: Talk to people to understand their common problems
  Too many people are quick to launch a brand, course, or service around a problem they haven’t validated as being extremely painful.
  Remember: everyone has problems. But people pay for 4 things only:
  • Time
  • Money
  • Sex
  • Approval/peace of mind

  What can you help people achieve? Who is 2-3 years behind you on their journey? Find those people and talk to them.
  Find out what is keeping them from their goals:
  1. Talk to 10-20 people
  2. Listen for common problems
  3. Put together a simple & unique solution
  4. Help them overcome those problems 
  That solution can be as easy as a short coaching program, a 7-day email course, or an eBook.
  Next, you’ll need to make people aware that you exist and can be helpful.
  Step 2: Grow a small audience around solving that problem
  Once you understand people’s most painful problems, and you have a solution to solve them, you need to generate awareness for yourself as a potential problem solver.
  So start creating content online, every single day that shows off your expertise.
  Look at the number of people who have built huge income streams around being known for solving one very specific problem.
  • I want a better job: Austin Belcak
  • I want to unlock my potential: Dan Koe
  • I want to write better emails: Cold Email Wizard
  • I want to attract women: Kamilla the Dating Coach
  They stay on message and on topic. Their content helps people solve these problems.
  Step 3: Build a small email list of interested people
  Once you create content around solving a specific problem, you’ll attract a small audience. But an audience is a finicky thing. Because you’re always at the mercy of each social media platform’s algorithm.
  That’s why I recommend building a small email list of interested people. A really simple way to do that is to offer something valuable in exchange for their email address.
  That can be a lead magnet like:
  1. A checklist
  2. A worksheet
  3. A video lesson
  4. Free toolkits & resources
  You want to make sure that whatever you offer, it’s directly related to the core problem you’re solving.
  Step 4: Use the easiest, cheapest, most familiar tech stack
  Once you have a great lead magnet, you need to offer it somewhere.
  This is the part that trips up 90% of people I see trying to make income on the internet.
  Don’t overcomplicate this.
  Start with a very simple website builder:
  - Carrd
  - Gumroad
  - Unicorn Platform
  - Umso
  Just pick what you know how to use!
  When people enter their email address, deliver the lead magnet.
  Once you have a few hundred emails, send an email out to people offering your unique solution that we discussed earlier.
  (Note: You can choose to leverage an expiring discount to create urgency, should you want to.)
  If people want to pay, make it easy. 
  Have a buy button in your email that sends them to a Stripe payment link or Gumroad payments page.
  If you offer a service, redirect them after payment to a Calendly link to book time with you.
  If you sell a product, deliver the product via email or host it on a platform like Gumroad.
  Conclusion:
  This is just one of many ways to earn your first $1 on the internet, so feel free to pick out things you learned in this issue and apply them to your unique situation.
  If you already have a nice following on social media, you can eliminate step 2 and simply start talking to your audience to understand their common problems.
  Sometimes, you don't need a lead magnet and instead can simply promote your product or services directly on Twitter or LinkedIn.
  It's up to you to get creative, and I hope this issue has given you something to think about in your journey.
  That's it: 4 steps to your first $1 on the internet.
