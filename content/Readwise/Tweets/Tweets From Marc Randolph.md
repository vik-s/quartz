## Highlights
- I often talk about the Canada Principle, which says that for a company, instead of blindly chasing down every compelling opportunity, you need to have the discipline to stay focused on the one or two things that are most important. 
  Or put another way, you have to recognize that what looks like low hanging fruit rarely is.
  But this advice can apply equally well to you as a person. Not only do you not have to be good at everything—you shouldn’t be. Think about the tasks you go through on a given day. How many of these would be better done by someone else? Or even better, not done at all? 
  Freeing yourself up from worrying about all that lets you allocate more time and attention to the important stuff. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mbrandolph/status/1713789435643674815))
