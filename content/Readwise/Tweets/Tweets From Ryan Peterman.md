## Highlights
- I'm looking for software engineers to share their stories about career growth on my newsletter (https://t.co/aolweeSTyE) with +23k readers: https://t.co/C79xb4ShZw
  Why share your story?
  • Reach a large, relevant audience (+23k software engineers) for your career
  • Build your brand and professional footprint - online writing & LinkedIn are a kind of resume
  • Get better at writing - I will work closely with you on editing until it's as good as possible
  • Help other engineers at scale
  What makes a good career growth story:
  • Actionable Learnings - should leave reader with concrete learnings they can apply
  • Quality Writing - concise & engaging
  • Unique & Transparent Storytelling - helps with engagement and how helpful the content is for others
  If there is someone whose story you've been curious to learn about, tag them in the comments ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanlpeterman/status/1713416918529655098))
