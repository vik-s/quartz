## Highlights
- Justin Welsh made $2,317,000 as a solopreneur in 2023.
  His creator backstory has been *crucial* in attracting a massive following & loyal customers.
  And anyone can write their own using Justin's 7-Step Backstory Framework.
  Here's how (with a free ChatGPT prompt to help): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1745838213753663968))
- Why does Justin's backstory work so well?
  Because people buy from people they know, like, and trust.
  So, how do you make yourself known at scale?
  • Be relatable
  • Be vulnerable
  • Share perspectives
  • Share how you solve problems
  Let's dive in! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1745838228173631963))
- Justin uses these 7 steps to write his story:
  Step 1: Obstacle
  Step 2: Internal Struggle
  Step 3: External Struggle
  Step 4: Change Event
  Step 5: Spark
  Step 6: Guide
  Step 7: Result
  You can tell a long version, short version, or just bits and pieces.
  But start with these steps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1745838233148088581))
- Step 1 and Step 7 are the start and finish of your transformation journey.
  They are mirror images of each other:
  • The Obstacle
  • The Result
  We can ask ChatGPT to use different transformation "types" to build our backstory narrative.
  Here's an example:

- Now, let’s feed the AI a version of your backstory.
  Remember, the quality of the story ChatGPT outputs depends on:
  • Your guidance
  • Your level of detail
  But, for brevity's sake, here's an "abbreviated" version of what you might input:

- Here's the good part.
  Run the Founder Story Framework prompt, and voilà, you have your backstory (the prompt is at the end of this thread):

- It’s not going to be 100% copy/paste ready.
  • Switch up the result and obstacle to frame your transformation from different angles
  • Try remixing the story with different tones and voices
  • Experiment until you are happy
  Then start sharing your story everywhere! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1745838264949391552))
- Boom! That's a wrap.
