- Someone will make $10M in 2024 with this exact playbook building cash-flowing internet businesses
  The playbook they'll use (save this):
  **1) Find underserved niche**
  I use tools like Etsyhunt, Google Trends, TikTok Creative Center, Redditlist, etc to do that. These spy tools are critical intel.
  This is the find your **"that's too small of a niche" **phase.
  **2) Build audience and community to drive growth**
  Design a content engine so good it's your pride and joy.
  This is the **"put billboards on the internet"** phase
  **3) Build a product (SaaS, software, agency, paid community, newsletter etc) with a beautiful brand**
  The impact of design is serious. I use <a href="https://twitter.com/DispatchDesign">@DispatchDesign</a> for my new ideas.
  This is the **"put buy buttons on the internet phase"**
  **4) Use AI agents and global workforce to fulfill product**
  AI agents or "artificial employees" as I call them aren't prime time yet. But they'll be able to 
  This is t**he operational excellence phase**
  **5) Hire operator and find start with step 1 again**
  Hire from within your community ideally. They'll get your niche better than an outsider.
  This is the **"scale me out of a job please"** phase.
  Usually, your business needs to be doing $100k+ profit per year to hire yourself out. 
  Most people do all 5 steps at once. 
  Being very careful to do one at a time is the key.
  250,000+ people were laid off in 2023. Anyone can build one of these businesses as a side project.
  I started my holding company as a side project 3+ years ago. 
  Now, we run 6 companies and I turned down multiple 8 figures offers to buy my holdco. In 2024, we'll do mid 7 figures of profit.
  This is multipreneurship. Multiple teams, multiple operators, multiple P&Ls.
  The future of entrepreneurship is multipreneurship.
  Save these 5 steps so you have them when you need it.
  Sharing this playbook in case it's helpful to someone.
  Enjoy!

- Someone should build this idea to FLIP the newsletter industry on its head
  Because we all know that no one has the time to read 20 newsletters a day
  Here's the free startup idea for you...
  The best newsletters have 50%+ open rates
  So EVEN if you're killing it, you're dead to half of your audience.
  Something is broken...
  The problem is people take free things for granted!!
  Even if you're flooding folks with value, they have no "investment" on their side.
  They are putting skin in the game. When you have skin in the game, you're more likely to come back.
  So, here's the idea!
  You stop opening the emails? You're off the list. Sorry, 
  You don't click any of the links? See you later.
  The point:
  The newsletter becomes the place for only the obsessed readers.
  I call it "Use it or lose it" newsletters.
  If this works, people are truly onboarded to free newsletters. They aren't just subscribing because why not. They are committing.
  You want commitment not subscribers.
  Imagine average open rates of 80-90%. It's totally possible with this model.
  Bonus idea for you (because why you follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/gregisenberg">@gregisenberg</a> ):
  I'd also consider capping the amount of subscribers per newsletter. 
  There is space, but not for everyone.
  I like the Andy Warhol quote on Studio 54 that relates to this:
  "Studio54 is a dictatorship at the door, but a democracy on the dancefloor"
  What do you think?
  Is it time to shake up the newsletter space?
  I think so... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1750155311044788359))
