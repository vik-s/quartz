- Someone will make $10M in 2024 with this exact playbook building cash-flowing internet businesses
  The playbook they'll use (save this):
  **1) Find underserved niche**
  I use tools like Etsyhunt, Google Trends, TikTok Creative Center, Redditlist, etc to do that. These spy tools are critical intel.
  This is the find your **"that's too small of a niche" **phase.
  **2) Build audience and community to drive growth**
  Design a content engine so good it's your pride and joy.
  This is the **"put billboards on the internet"** phase
  **3) Build a product (SaaS, software, agency, paid community, newsletter etc) with a beautiful brand**
  The impact of design is serious. I use <a href="https://twitter.com/DispatchDesign">@DispatchDesign</a> for my new ideas.
  This is the **"put buy buttons on the internet phase"**
  **4) Use AI agents and global workforce to fulfill product**
  AI agents or "artificial employees" as I call them aren't prime time yet. But they'll be able to 
  This is t**he operational excellence phase**
  **5) Hire operator and find start with step 1 again**
  Hire from within your community ideally. They'll get your niche better than an outsider.
  This is the **"scale me out of a job please"** phase.
  Usually, your business needs to be doing $100k+ profit per year to hire yourself out. 
  Most people do all 5 steps at once. 
  Being very careful to do one at a time is the key.
  250,000+ people were laid off in 2023. Anyone can build one of these businesses as a side project.
  I started my holding company as a side project 3+ years ago. 
  Now, we run 6 companies and I turned down multiple 8 figures offers to buy my holdco. In 2024, we'll do mid 7 figures of profit.
  This is multipreneurship. Multiple teams, multiple operators, multiple P&Ls.
  The future of entrepreneurship is multipreneurship.
  Save these 5 steps so you have them when you need it.
  Sharing this playbook in case it's helpful to someone.
  Enjoy!

- Someone should build this idea to FLIP the newsletter industry on its head
  Because we all know that no one has the time to read 20 newsletters a day
  Here's the free startup idea for you...
  The best newsletters have 50%+ open rates
  So EVEN if you're killing it, you're dead to half of your audience.
  Something is broken...
  The problem is people take free things for granted!!
  Even if you're flooding folks with value, they have no "investment" on their side.
  They are putting skin in the game. When you have skin in the game, you're more likely to come back.
  So, here's the idea!
  You stop opening the emails? You're off the list. Sorry, 
  You don't click any of the links? See you later.
  The point:
  The newsletter becomes the place for only the obsessed readers.
  I call it "Use it or lose it" newsletters.
  If this works, people are truly onboarded to free newsletters. They aren't just subscribing because why not. They are committing.
  You want commitment not subscribers.
  Imagine average open rates of 80-90%. It's totally possible with this model.
  Bonus idea for you (because why you follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/gregisenberg">@gregisenberg</a> ):
  I'd also consider capping the amount of subscribers per newsletter. 
  There is space, but not for everyone.
  I like the Andy Warhol quote on Studio 54 that relates to this:
  "Studio54 is a dictatorship at the door, but a democracy on the dancefloor"
  What do you think?
  Is it time to shake up the newsletter space?
  I think so... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1750155311044788359))

- I heard something **Sam Altman** say a few years ago that's on my mind: 
  "Adjusted for the subjective increase in how fast time passes, life is **half over** by 23 or 24". 
  The older you get, the faster time seems to pass by.
  I've been thinking about more and more ways to slow it down and enjoy every moment. Life moves quick. 
  When you're a kid, life's full of new stuff, making time feel slow. 
  As you grow up, fresh experiences get scarce, and time zips by. 
  It's a bittersweet truth - less novelty, less time to enjoy it. 
  So my point is, embrace new experiences to savor the passage of time 
  And related to this is... I've learned that startup life ages you. 
  So, if you're thinking about doing something new... 
  Honestly, do it. Go wild. 
  **Isn't now the time?**
  This is the best time to start a company in 30 years. 
  Think about it...
  Between buying distressed VC-assets, partnering with creators, owning internet audiences, AI, VR finally becoming useful, GPT store is the new app store, productized services, paid communities, tiktok stores, multipreneurship, solopreneurship etc etc 
  This a darn good time to get started to build a company, start a social account, do whatever it is that's on your mind. 
  Maybe Sam Altman was right or wrong on the life is half over by 24, but it gets you thinking...
  Every second counts. Make it count.
  And feeling like a kid, makes everyday feel new and interesting. An adventure.
  Shoot your shot.

- **How to write good copy for the internet (a guide):**
  Bad copy kills businesses, good copy makes them.
  I think we’re entering an era where the best products don’t necessarily win, the best copy does.
  Most people write copy like they are writing instruction manuals.
  They got lost in explaining how the sausage is made and no one cares.
  And even worse they use that same robotic copy in the content they create.
  **1. Paint a picture**
  Make your reader see, feel, and believe in the world you're describing as if they're living it. It's like telling a story that they become a part of.
  **2. Conversational tone**
  Write like you're chatting with a friend. It should feel easy and friendly, making your reader feel right at home.
  **3. Use line breaks generously**
  Space out your sentences like breathing spaces in a conversation. It makes everything easier to read and feels less crowded. People don;t have time to read dense paragraphs when you are competing with TikTok and Instagram.
  **4. Hone in on a single focal point**
  Keep your message tight around one big idea. It's like using a spotlight in a dark room to show off the most important thing.
  **5. Shows credibility with examples**
  Use real stories or examples to prove your point. It's like showing a picture to prove you've been somewhere cool.
  **6. Anticipates concerns and works through objections**
  Think ahead about what might bother your reader and talk it out. It's like answering their questions before they've even asked them.
  **7. Entertaining**
  Keep things fun or interesting so your reader enjoys reading. It’s like adding a dash of spice to make a meal tastier.
  **8. Know who you’re trying to reach**
  Write for someone specific, like you know exactly who they are, what they like, and what they need. It’s like picking out a gift for a good friend.
  **9. Show how the product works**
  Explain how things work in simple terms. It’s like explaining a game so everyone can play.
  **10. Has clear calls-to-action**
  Be clear about what you want your reader to do next. It’s like giving clear directions so someone doesn’t get lost.
  **11. Don’t be a robot**
  Put some personality in your writing. It’s like wearing your favorite outfit instead of a uniform.
  **12. Be different than your competition**
  Stand out by being yourself. It’s like choosing to dance to your own music when everyone else is doing the same dance.
  13. Use positive words
  Use words that make people feel good and hopeful. It’s like smiling through your words.
  **14. Avoid exclamation points**
  Use them sparingly. It’s like not shouting in a conversation.
  **15. Clear and concise**
  Keep it short and sweet. It’s like telling a story without adding unnecessary details.
  **16. Safe copy is risky copy**
  Dare to be different. It’s like taking a new path through the woods instead of the worn trail.
  **17. Be interesting, be brave**
  Write something that grabs attention. It’s like telling a story that no one wants to end.
  **18. Every word matters**
  Choose your words carefully. It’s like picking out just the right ingredients for a recipe.
  I hope this guide has been helpful. You can follow me [gregisenberg](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg) for more of this stuff.
  Happy writing.
