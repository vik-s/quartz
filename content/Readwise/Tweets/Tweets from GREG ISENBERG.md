- Someone will make $10M in 2024 with this exact playbook building cash-flowing internet businesses
  The playbook they'll use (save this):
  **1) Find underserved niche**
  I use tools like Etsyhunt, Google Trends, TikTok Creative Center, Redditlist, etc to do that. These spy tools are critical intel.
  This is the find your **"that's too small of a niche" **phase.
  **2) Build audience and community to drive growth**
  Design a content engine so good it's your pride and joy.
  This is the **"put billboards on the internet"** phase
  **3) Build a product (SaaS, software, agency, paid community, newsletter etc) with a beautiful brand**
  The impact of design is serious. I use <a href="https://twitter.com/DispatchDesign">@DispatchDesign</a> for my new ideas.
  This is the **"put buy buttons on the internet phase"**
  **4) Use AI agents and global workforce to fulfill product**
  AI agents or "artificial employees" as I call them aren't prime time yet. But they'll be able to 
  This is t**he operational excellence phase**
  **5) Hire operator and find start with step 1 again**
  Hire from within your community ideally. They'll get your niche better than an outsider.
  This is the **"scale me out of a job please"** phase.
  Usually, your business needs to be doing $100k+ profit per year to hire yourself out. 
  Most people do all 5 steps at once. 
  Being very careful to do one at a time is the key.
  250,000+ people were laid off in 2023. Anyone can build one of these businesses as a side project.
  I started my holding company as a side project 3+ years ago. 
  Now, we run 6 companies and I turned down multiple 8 figures offers to buy my holdco. In 2024, we'll do mid 7 figures of profit.
  This is multipreneurship. Multiple teams, multiple operators, multiple P&Ls.
  The future of entrepreneurship is multipreneurship.
  Save these 5 steps so you have them when you need it.
  Sharing this playbook in case it's helpful to someone.
  Enjoy!
