## Highlights
- I grew my newsletter from 0 to 10,000+ subscribers with a 59% open rate and 23% CTR… in 6 months.
  Here’s how I did it.
  Plus what worked, what okay worked, and what failed:
  **The First 100 Subscribers**
  I got the first 100 by:
  - Twitter and LinkedIn posts to my ~800 followers (drove 75 subscribers)
  - Added a CTA for my newsletter in my email signature (drove ~10 subscribers)
  - Asked close friends and clients to subscribe (drove ~15 subscribers)
  After that, I needed to hone in on acquisition channels….
  **What Worked Great**
  ***Twitter - 4,219 subscribers, 65% open rate, 26% CTR***
  Writing 1 thread per week and posting every day has had the largest impact on my newsletter growth.
  Also, optimizing my profile was key in converting views into subscribers.
  Think of your profile as an ad for people to follow you and join your newsletter.
  Work on improving every element of that “ad” — Your profile picture, header, description, location, etc.
  Next, I turned to paid…
  ***Twitter Ads - 2,314 subscribers, 60% open rate, 13% CTR***
  I’ve spent $6,231 on Twitter ads to acquire 2,314 subscribers at a $2.69 CPA (cost per subscriber)
  I offset my ad investment with Sparkloop Upscribe and beehiiv boosts.
  With these tools I’m able to earn ~$1 per subscriber, making my net CPA $1.69.
  **What Kinda Worked**
  ***Referral program - 339 subscribers, 49% open rate, 20% CTR***
  Users unlock a reward after referring 1 subscriber. 
  These can be great for more popular niches, but can be tough for niches with smaller overall interest.
  ***Cross-promotions - 250 subscribers, 70% open rate, 30% CTR***
  These were hit or miss. 
  Some of mine generated 100+ subscribers, some generated under 10.
  However, cross-promos have generated some of my highest-quality subscribers.
  ***beehiiv boosts - 411 subscribers, 44% open rate, 8% CTR***
  Boosts are a great way to grow with paid ads if you don't have the time or skill for FB or Twitter ads.
  They're mostly automated.
  **What Didn’t Work**
  ***Newsletter ads - ~150 subscribers, ~65% open rate***
  I bought 4 ads in other newsletters. 3 flopped, 1 worked well. 
  Small sample size, but not great results. 
  I'll test this again later using CPC deals and beehiiv's ad network.
  ***Facebook ads - 100 subscribers, 25% open rate***
  I spent $589 on FB ads to acquire 100 subscribers at a $5.89 CPA (cost per subscriber).
  FB ads are amazing but they didn’t work out well for me (yet).
  My content is niche and I didn’t do much creative testing. 
  **Here’s a breakdown of where all subscribers are from:**
  - Twitter organic: 4,219
  - Twitter ads: 2,921
  - Website direct: 1,333
  - Google organic: 548
  - Beehiiv boosts: 367
  - Referral: 346
  - Other: 2,617
  Hope this helps!
  I'll report back at 20k subscribers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1712090772424511835))

- A successful newsletter starts with engagement.
  When people are reading they're more likely to stick around (retention) and to share it (acquisition).
  How do you measure and improve engagement?
  Unfortunately, open rates are no longer the answer.
  **Here's what to use instead...**
  The engagement metrics you should track and prioritize (in order):
  1. CTR
  2. Poll responses
  3. Reply rate
  4. Open rate
  (Always use unique clicks, CTR, replies, and opens).
  **Why is open rate not #1?**
  Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) killed open rate. 
  To oversimplify it - MPP "opens" emails even if they're not opened. This makes open rate metrics unreliable.
  And MMP is impacting **55%+ of opens**.
  You should still track and consider open rates, but clicks are king now.
  Think about it:
  The only reliable way subscribers add value to your newsletter is by clicking a:
  - Sponsors link
  - Product link
  - Or any link (which improves your deliverability)
  You have no idea if a person who opened actually read the newsletter...
  Or if that open was automated by MPP.
  So what should you do now?
  **Use more links and ask people to click them.**
  Here’s how:
  - Add more contextual links to other content/products (ideally your content).
  - Add more call-to-actions for your products/sponsors.
  - Include a curated link section in your newsletter.
  - Ask people to click a link to stay subscribed
  - Use polls 
  **Use a poll in every newsletter send**
  I like this "5 star, 3 star, 1 star" format:
  Aim for 80%+ 5-star reviews and more poll responses each send.
  Hope this helps! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1716518573604995097))

  Harry also offers 1on1 coaching for $900 — if he sells 3 calls per week, that’s an extra $140K in annual revenue.
  Plus, Harry has a course he’s sold in the past. Course revenue can likely surpass ad and coaching revenue when it is live.

  For sponsorships, we can assume a $50 CPM on opens.
  At 170k subscribers, 2 sends per week, and a 45% open rate, that’s $397,800 in sponsorships revenue.
  Then if 2% of newsletter subscribers buy their annual course subscription at $499/year, that’s $1,696,600 in ARR.

- Here are revenue streams you can create from a newsletter:
  • Events
  • Agency
  • Courses
  • Affiliates
  • Speaking
  • Coaching
  • Job board
  • Consulting
  • Mastermind
  • Sponsorships 
  • Paid newsletter
  • Lead generation
  • Paid community
  • Data subscription
  There's more. 
  But these are generally the best fit for media founders. 
  If you only use sponsors and affiliates you need to start selling a product/service asap. 
  If you're starting a newsletter, think about your product/service offer from day 1.
  The best newsletters are distribution channels for a high LTV product -- not just a place to sell ads. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1729878340100911302))
