  Here are 4 simple examples that might help: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1717897949538120010))
    - Note: Save
- 1. Build a service-based business
  Why I like a service-based business: 
  Generally, easier and lower cost to get started.
  Plus you can likely charge 3x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.
  Find people 2-3 years behind you in your expertise and help them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1717897972438991331))
- 2. Create a digital course
  Why I like digital courses: 
  People can purchase the courses 24/7/365.
  Once you've serviced people using example 1 (above) take your biggest learnings and put them in a course.
  Build a small affiliate program to drive even more sales. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1717897995465666819))
- 3. Start a paid community
  Why I like paid communities:
  Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, & deepens relationships.
  This helps grow your audience and build your business.
  Get this right and it's powerful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1717898019478159758))
- 4. Create a subscription email
  Why I like subscription emails:
  The scale is incredible. 
  As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make a lot more money without much extra work ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1717898041791832388))
