## Highlights
- I gained 150,000+ followers last year by writing 2-3 hours a week
  This is the 22 things I've learned about writing on the internet (all my tips & tricks) in the last 12 months
  1. The best posts are written **without** ChatGPT
  2. Be entertaining, educational or ideally **both**
  3. Make the posts about **them**, never about **you** 
  4. Delete **non-useful **words. Every word matters
  5. Write like you talk **100%** of the time
  6. Use **cliffhangers**. Algorithms will love you for it
  7. Pick words that **stick** in people's brains
  8. **Spacing** matters. Make it easy to scan
  9. Always be **clear** & concise
  10. Stories work 10x non stories‚Äì‚Äì **hook**, **problem**, **solution**
  11. The only content strategy you'll need: **overload** people with value on every post
  12. Use **lists** often, people bookmark/RT them 
  13. Write as clear as possible. **Plain** english > fancy words
  14. Use **numbers**/data as a way to hook, but never mislead
  15. Use **questions** throughout the post not just beginning or end ‚Äì‚Äì like did I miss anything?
  16. Address your audience **directly **
  17. **Adapt** **tone**/length for each platform
  18. Don't take yourself too seriously. Have **fun** with it
  19. Inject **personality** in every sentence
  20. ‚ÄúHow vain it is to sit down to write when you have not **stood up to live**.‚Äù
  21. People **can tell if you use AI **in your words or images
  22. **Controversy sells**. The algo rewards it for better or for worse
  The reality is this:
  100,000 followers is pretty attainable for anyone.
  It's 273 followers a day. 
  Anyone with an internet connection and some wonderful words can do it.

  Btw, even if you're trying to go build an audience on short-form video, writing is the foundation. 
  Every good script starts with a pen & paper.
  Happy writing! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1743010203660857481))
