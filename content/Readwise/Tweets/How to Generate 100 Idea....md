## Highlights
- How to generate 100 ideas to write about in 30 minutes - even if you think you have nothing to say:
  My promise is to solve all 3 of these problems by the end of this post: 
  1. You're not sure what topics to write about
  2. You're not sure how to find the topics you're credible enough to write about
  3. You're not sure how to come up with engaging ideas about those topics
  1 rule before we dive in:
  During this exercise, do not let yourself start judging the quality of your ideas.
  The goal here is to generate a ton of raw materials, knowing you won't write about 90% of them.
  BUT - you will emerge with crystal clear clarity.
  Let's go.

  Quick overview of The Endless Idea Generator:
  Step 1. Use the 2-Year Test to find your topic ideas
  Step 2. Add specificity to match your credibility
  Step 3. Use the 4A Framework + proven approaches to generate ideas
  Step 4. Choose 3 ideas to write about over the next 3 days

  Step 1: The 2-Year Test
  Finding the general topics you want to write about starts with asking yourself 1 simple question: 
  "What are all of the problems I've solved and topics I've learned about over the last 2 years?"
  Why 2 years? 
  Good question:
  One of the biggest mistakes beginner writers make is thinking they have to be an "expert" to write about something. 
  But this is wrong. 
  The truth is, people don't want to learn from experts. 
  They prefer to learn from those just a few steps ahead of them on the same path.
  And once you realize this, it's a huge creative unlock. 
  So answer the question and brain dump every problem you've solved and topic you've learned in the last 2 years.
  Get them all out there with no judgment.
  Now you have a long list of topics. 
  Turns out you have plenty to write about!
  From here, you are going to narrow it down to 3 buckets.
  To do this, listen for internal resonance.
  Which topics jumped off the page right when you wrote them down? 
  Lean into those and latch on.
  When I did this recently, I emerged with 3 buckets:
  • How to build a writing habit
  • All things journaling and asking high-quality questions
  • General golden nugget growth frameworks
  You should have your 3 buckets as well. 
  Now, onto the next step.

  Step 2: Adding specificity
  Remember how I said you don't have to be an expert? 
  That was only half-true. 
  You do need to be an expert in a topic to write about it - but you simply need to tweak the topic by adding specificity to match your level of credibility. 
  Here's what I mean:
  Recall the 2-year Test. These are all of the problems you've solved in the last 2 years. 
  Now, you're going to take your topics and add a level of specificity that makes the audience you're writing to *the same person you were 2 years ago before you solved the problem*
  Pause for a second and stare at that, it's important.
  You are adding a level of specificity to your topic that makes your target audience the person you were 2 years ago.
  An example will help drive this home.
  Here's how my 3 topics evolved:
  1. How to build a writing habit for complete beginner writers
  2. Journaling for ambitious entrepreneurs who aren't yet journaling but know they should be
  3. General golden nuggets of wisdom for ambitious 20-somethings who are interested in personal growth
  Can you see how I cut out a *huge* number of people with my additions of specificity? 
  That's the point.
  This helps me generate ideas *specifically* to solve the problems of my target audience.
  Here's how to get specific:
  You can add specificity in a number of ways
  • Age
  • Gender
  • Profession
  • Background
  • Level of experience
  I encourage you to dial these up and down until you feel *uncomfortably specific*, then add one more level. 
  That's when you know you've gotten specific enough.
  Here's where the real fun begins.

  Step 3: Using the 4A Framework to write headlines
  You can express each of your topics in 4 ways:
  • Actionable (here's how) 
  • Analytics (here are the numbers)
  • Aspirational (yes, you can)
  • Anthropological (here's why)
  Actionable
  These are actionable, implemental pieces of content.
  The reader should gain some new insight or instruction they didn't have beforehand.
  • Tips
  • Hacks
  • Resources
  • Ultimate guides
  Take your core idea and help the reader put it into practice.
  Analytical
  These are breakdowns involving numbers, frameworks, and processes.
  Take your core idea and support it with numbers and analysis.
  • Industry trends
  • Surprising numbers
  • Why your idea works
  Help the reader unlock a new way of thinking.
  Aspirational
  These are stories of how you or others put your core idea into practice.
  • Lessons
  • Mistakes
  • Reflections
  • Underrated traits
  • How to get started
  Help the reader understand the benefits they unlock when they see the world through this new lens.
  Anthropological
  These are things that speak to universal human nature.
  • Fears
  • Failures
  • Struggles
  • Why others are wrong
  • How you've been misled
  Create a sense of urgency for the reader to fully embrace your core idea or be forever left behind.
  As you can see, I had quite a few ideas here - 24 to be exact (just for this first bucket, and I repeated this for all 3 buckets I generated which brought me over 100)
  Now this brings us to the final step.

  Step 4: Choose 3 ideas
  You're sitting there with a ton of ideas on the page - and now you have the problem of potentially *too many* ideas to write about - which is better than having nothing to write about.
  But many writers will fall into the analysis paralysis trap here.
  Here's how to overcome it:
  Pick 3 ideas. That's it. 
  Your next 3 days of content. 
  The 3 ideas that most resonated with you from that list. 
  And that's all you're allowed to take away from these ideas (for now).
  Because here's what's going to happen:
  When you start writing about your first idea (that idea that jumped right off the page), it's going to feel effortless.
  And in the process of writing, more ideas are going to jump into your head.
  When you hit publish on this idea, the market feedback is going to generate even more ideas (if you're paying attention to the questions, critiques, engagement, resonance, etc.)
  This is the main point of the EIG - to get you *started* writing about ideas that resonate with you.
  And once you're getting them out there consistently, it will be dead obvious what you should write about next.
  So take your 3 ideas and get going! 
  The rest will take care of itself.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9sBB1MWEAAzk-V.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1718968819362787392))
