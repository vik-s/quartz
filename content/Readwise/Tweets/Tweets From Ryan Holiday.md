## Highlights
- “If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you’re functionally illiterate.” That comes from General Mattis. Maybe it sounds harsh, but it’s true.
  His point was that humans have been fighting and dying and struggling and doing the same things for eons. To not avail yourself of that knowledge is profoundly arrogant and stupid. To fill up body bags of young soldiers while a commander learns by experience? It’s worse than arrogant. It’s unethical, even murderous.
  We need to study the cautionary tales and the screw ups, read about failures and successes. If you don’t, it’s a dereliction of duty. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1715098121011703843))
