## Highlights
- Most editing advice is as bland as dry toast.
  "Step away and edit with fresh eyes.”
  "Read your work out loud."
  "Read it on a different screen."​
  ​
  ​This is so basic.
  ​
  What are you meant to look for? When something feels off, how do you change it? Where do you start?!
  Well, get your toast out because I'm about to butter it.
  There are three editing types.
  1. Developmental editing
  2. Copy editing
  3. Proofreading
  I do them in that order. You want to start with the big picture, then zoom in.
  1. Developmental editing = Structural editing
  Use it to evaluate:
  -Does it answer 'the why' behind your readers' intent?
  -Is your perspective accurately reflected?
  -Are arguments supported & complete?
  -Is your narrative ordered correctly?
  -Does it meet awareness levels?
  2. Copy editing = Flow, format, & function
  Use it to check:
  -Do paragraphs flow seamlessly?
  -Are sentences written in active voice?
  -Is it free of redundant words/phrases/ideas?
  -Does it include “the why” behind “the what”?
  -Does it have takeaways?
  3. Proofreading = Nitpicking
  -Does it have spelling mistakes/awkward spacing/dialect errors?
  (My proofreading process is honestly quite short. This is the only thing I use Grammarly for and I still ignore it half the time.)
  -------------
  Switching to an editor's mindset is all about going from "this is good enough" to "what's missing?"
  And when you follow this 3-step process, it makes it easier to catch both big and little mistakes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericasmyname/status/1732409233168052536))
    - Note: Save
- In 3 weeks, I'm releasing editing 101. Learning how to edit has made me a million times better at writing. And I'm tired of the dry toast advice that doesn't help you learn and improve.
