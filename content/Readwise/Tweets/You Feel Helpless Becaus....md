- You aren't where you want to be because you didn't make the thousands of tiny decisions that led to a purposeful career, fulfilling relationships, or a healthy and aesthetic body over the past year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556081973502285))
- If the good life is created by a series of high-quality decisions, and high-quality decisions only come from improvement after low-quality decisions, then it is in your best interest to fail hard and often with a smile on your face.

- If people don’t understand why you make the decisions you do, you’re an outlier. You aren’t like 99% of people doomed to an average life. You are either on the wrong path and must learn from your mistakes, or you are on the right path and must ignore almost everyone’s opinions.

- The only thing standing between where you are and where you want to be is a series of decisions that most people refuse to make. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556091507048742))
- Better decisions boil down to pausing, zooming out to gain perspective, perceiving the situation in a way that helps you achieve your goal, and acting regardless of how you feel. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556094518661233))
- You encounter life-changing situations every day. But most people don’t have the emotional maturity to make the right decision that leads to their lives being changed. Their mind is clouded with stress and anxiety so their first option is to find comfort and pleasure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556097727246782))
- Most people are assigned goals as they age that they never question. Go to school, get a job, retire with barely enough money to survive. If you don't have a meaningful goal that you create, you don't have a chance at making a good decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556100826800501))
- Your identity shapes your goals. Goals shape your perspective. Perspective limits how many opportunities you can perceive. Most people don't have options beyond the ones society assigned to their identity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556103842541672))
- If you want to guarantee a better future, always consult your ideal lifestyle before making an important decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1717556106933735902))
