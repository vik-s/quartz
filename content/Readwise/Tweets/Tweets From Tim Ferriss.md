## Highlights
- I often think of the below story introduced to me by Tara Brach: 
  *"This is a story about a tiger named Mohini that was in captivity in a zoo, who was rescued from an animal sanctuary. Mohini had been confined to a 10-by-10-foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10-by-10 feet was worn bare of grass. . . . Perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns." *
  **What past limitations—real or perceived—are you carrying as baggage? Where in your life are you pacing in a 10-by-10-foot patch of grass? Where are you afraid of getting sprayed with water, even though it’s never happened? Oftentimes, everything you want is a mere inch outside of your comfort zone. Test it.** ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1712861572006019243))

- Every writer has a slightly different process, but they all start with the same thing: a blank page. 
  **Even if you don’t consider yourself a writer (I never did), putting thoughts on paper is the best way to A) develop ideas, and B) review and improve your thinking. **
  The benefits of even 30 minutes a week of scribbling can transfer to everything else that you do. 
  The following bullets are writing prompts that Cheryl Strayed (@CherylStrayed) has suggested when asked for assignment ideas for students who’ve read *Wild*.
  They are brilliant and make fantastic jumping-off points for any type of journaling or writing, whether Morning Pages, a blog post, the beginning of a novel, a letter to a friend, a diary entry, a screenplay, or a too-fast-too-soon Tinder message. 
  **Try one for two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and don’t stop to edit. Step one is to generate without judging. Chances are that you’ll surprise yourself. **
  Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken. 
  Write about a lesson you learned the hard way. 
  Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion. 
  Write about something you lost that you’ll never get back. 
  Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing. 
  Write about something you don’t remember. 
  Write about your darkest teacher. 
  Write about a memory of a physical injury. 
  Write about when you knew it was over. 
  Write about being loved. 
  Write about what you were really thinking. 
  Write about how you found your way back. 
  Write about the kindness of strangers. 
  Write about why you could not do it. 
  Write about why you did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1714592949290389521))

- It’s fun to think about getting an MBA.
  They’re attractive for many reasons: developing new business skills, developing a better business network, or—most often—taking what is effectively a two-year vacation that looks good on a resume.
  In 2001, and again in 2004, I wanted to do all three things.
  I was ready to apply to Stanford Business School. Who wouldn’t be?
  I enthusiastically began a process I would repeat twice: downloading the application to get started, taking the full campus tour, and sitting in on other classes.
  Some were incredible, taught by all-stars who’d done it all, but others—many others—were taught by PhD theoreticians who used big words and lots of Powerpoint slides. One teacher spent 45 minutes on slide after slide of equations that could be summed up with “If you build a crappy product, people won’t buy it.” No one needed to prove that to me with differential calculus.
  At the end of that class, I turned to my student guide for the tour and asked him how it compared to other classes. He answered: “Oh, this is easily my favorite.”
  That was the death of business school for me.
  By 2005, I was done chasing my tail with business school, but I still ached to learn more.
  Then, in 2007, I started having more frequent lunches with the brilliant Mike Maples, Jr (@m2jr). 
  Our conversations usually bounced between a few topics, including physical performance, marketing campaigns (I’d just launched The 4-Hour Workweek), and his latest focus: angel investing.
  “Angel investing” involves putting relatively small amounts of money—often from $15,000 to $100,000—into early-stage start-ups. In Mike’s world, “early-stage” could mean two engineers with a prototype for a website, or it could mean a successful serial entrepreneur with a new idea. The angels usually have relevant business experience and are considered “smart money”—their advice and introductions are just as valuable as the money they put in.
  After several lunches with Mike, I’d found my business school.
  I decided to make (in my mind) a two-year “Tim Ferriss Fund” that would replace Stanford business school.
  Stanford GSB isn’t cheap. I rounded it down to $60,000 a year, for a total of $120,000 over two years (these days, it’s $100,000+ per year).
  For the “Tim Ferriss Fund,” I would aim to intelligently spend $120,000 over two years on angel investing in $10-20,000 chunks, so 6-12 companies in total. The goal of this “business school” would be to learn as much as possible about start-up finance, deal structuring, rapid product design, initiating acquisition conversations, etc. as possible.
  The curriculum could be thought of as “The Start-up Lifecycle from Birth to Acquisition/IPO or Death.” But curriculum was just part of business school; the other part was getting to know the “students,” preferably the most astute movers and shakers in the start-up investing world. Business school = curriculum + network.
  The most important characteristic of my personal MBA: **I planned on “losing” $120,000.**
  I went into the “Tim Ferriss Fund” viewing the $120,000 as sunk tuition costs, but also expecting that the lessons learned, and people met, would be worth that $120,000 investment. **The two-year plan was to methodically spend $120,000 for the learning experience, not for the ROI.**
  I would ***not*** suggest mimicking this approach:
  1) Unless you have a clear informational advantage—insider access—that gives you a competitive advantage. I lived in the nexus of Silicon Valley and knew many top CEOs and investors, so I had better sources of information than the vast majority of the world. I don’t invest in public companies precisely because I know that professionals have better access to information than I do.
  2) Unless you are 100% comfortable losing your “MBA” funds. You should only gamble with what you’re very comfortable losing. If financial loss drives you to even mild desperation or depression, you shouldn’t do it.
  3) Unless you have started and/or managed successful businesses in the past.
  4) Unless you limit angel investment funds to 10% or less of your liquid assets. I subscribe to the Nassim Taleb school of investment, with 90% in conservative asset classes and the remaining 10% in speculative investments that can capitalize on positive “black swans”.

- **Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):**
  1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.
  2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.
  3) Write down the 3-5 things—and no more—that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually = most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict.
  4) For each item, ask yourself:
  – “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?”
  – “Will moving this forward make all the other to-do’s unimportant or easier to knock off later?”
  5) Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions.
  6) Block out at least 2-3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.
  7) TO BE CLEAR: Block out at least 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work.
  8) If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.
  Congratulations! That’s it.
  This is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my never-ending impulse to procrastinate, nap, and otherwise fritter away my days with bullshit. 
  If I have 10 important things to do in a day, it’s 100% certain nothing important will get done that day. On the other hand, I can usually handle 1 must-do item and block out my lesser behaviors for 2-3 hours a day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1716836684661453094))

- I have read this book many times. It’s a wonderful and short reboot for possibility, excellent for all students of life and those who want to overcome self-imposed limitations.
