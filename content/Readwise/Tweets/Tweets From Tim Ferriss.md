## Highlights
- I often think of the below story introduced to me by Tara Brach: 
  *"This is a story about a tiger named Mohini that was in captivity in a zoo, who was rescued from an animal sanctuary. Mohini had been confined to a 10-by-10-foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture: With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10-by-10 feet was worn bare of grass. . . . Perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns." *
  **What past limitations—real or perceived—are you carrying as baggage? Where in your life are you pacing in a 10-by-10-foot patch of grass? Where are you afraid of getting sprayed with water, even though it’s never happened? Oftentimes, everything you want is a mere inch outside of your comfort zone. Test it.** ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1712861572006019243))

- Every writer has a slightly different process, but they all start with the same thing: a blank page. 
  **Even if you don’t consider yourself a writer (I never did), putting thoughts on paper is the best way to A) develop ideas, and B) review and improve your thinking. **
  The benefits of even 30 minutes a week of scribbling can transfer to everything else that you do. 
  The following bullets are writing prompts that Cheryl Strayed (@CherylStrayed) has suggested when asked for assignment ideas for students who’ve read *Wild*.
  They are brilliant and make fantastic jumping-off points for any type of journaling or writing, whether Morning Pages, a blog post, the beginning of a novel, a letter to a friend, a diary entry, a screenplay, or a too-fast-too-soon Tinder message. 
  **Try one for two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and don’t stop to edit. Step one is to generate without judging. Chances are that you’ll surprise yourself. **
  Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken. 
  Write about a lesson you learned the hard way. 
  Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion. 
  Write about something you lost that you’ll never get back. 
  Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing. 
  Write about something you don’t remember. 
  Write about your darkest teacher. 
  Write about a memory of a physical injury. 
  Write about when you knew it was over. 
  Write about being loved. 
  Write about what you were really thinking. 
  Write about how you found your way back. 
  Write about the kindness of strangers. 
  Write about why you could not do it. 
  Write about why you did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1714592949290389521))
