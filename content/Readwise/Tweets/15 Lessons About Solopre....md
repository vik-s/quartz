    - Note: Save
- 1/ Plan
  When you're running 100 mph, things get chaotic.
  Over the years, I started breaking my revenue goals down to the day.
  Bite-sized goals are more approachable & help increase your likelihood of success.
  I highly suggest backing into yours by month, week, and day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620099372646638))
- 2/ Reduce
  My 4 revenue streams run on so many pieces of technology.
  Bills add up, things break, and opportunities are missed.
  I cut a bunch of technology and folded all of my businesses into fewer products.
  All-in-one tech makes things so much more manageable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620102233215017))
- 3/ Repurpose
  My business runs on content.
  And after writing unique pieces every day for over 4 years, I started to repurpose
  It made me nervous. The outcome?
  Nobody noticed and the pieces were widely read by people who had never seen them the first time around. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620105106325937))
- 4/ Focus
  I've spent time as a SaaS advisor, coach, mentor, investor, and digital product creator.
  2021 was the first year I spent the majority of my time focused on products revenue.
  2020: 19% of income
  2021: 52% of revenue
  2022: 73% of revenue
  2023: 75% of revenue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620107861889060))
- 5/ Rest
  In 2019, I burned out at my executive job.
  In early 2022, I was running the risk of doing the same as a creator.
  My solution?
  - 4-mile daily walks
  - 30-minute built-in breaks
  - One day per week off
  In 2024, I'm moving to a 3-day workweek. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620110802104734))
- 6/ Ignore
  With 1M social media followers across 2 channels, you get a lot of nasty comments.
  People are mean. Angry. Condescending. Cruel. Shitty.
  I got aggressive with the block button last year. I'll do the same this year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620113713057840))
- 7/ Collaborate
  2023 was been all about collaboration for me.
  I've met about 10-15 people here on Twitter that I regularly speak to for advice.
  Just jamming out, building in public, releasing products, and supporting one another.
  Heavy focus on relationships in 2024. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620116623896772))
- 8/ Give
  Over the last few years, I gave a lot of money and time back.
  It was overwhelming and gave me purpose.
  This year, I'll continue to give away my time, donate to causes I support, & spread love anonymously. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620119442423838))
- 9/ Ask
  You don't get what you don't ask for. 
  That doesn't mean ask willy-nilly. It means being smart with my asks.
  This year, I've talked to people I never would have imagined.
  Interviewed amazing guests. Was featured on sites I felt were out of my reach. Ask! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620122340679981))
- 10/ Listen
  My business started taking off when I remembered that my customers tell me what to create next.
  Instead of building what I wanted, I asked more questions and listened intently to the answers.
  The result? 
  17,500 people on my new product waitlist. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620125192798459))
- 11/ Diversify
  Until late 2021, I was on one social platform: LinkedIn
  I had grown to 275k+ followers but had always felt a bit timid on Twitter.
  27 months ago, I decided to just go for it. The result? 460k followers interested in my journey.
  Diversify where you create. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620128011399241))
- 12/ Eliminate
  In balancing my businesses, I was doing a lot of things I didn't like doing.
  So, I just started saying no to things I didn't enjoy.
  The easiest way for me to do this was with "No" templates.
  Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls">@thepatwalls</a> for his "How to Say No" series. Lifesaver. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620130846744985))
- <a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls">@thepatwalls</a> 13/ Relax
  Back in 2021, I felt frustrated by social media.
  I was succeeding in building my network and businesses, but politics & the world were upsetting.
  So, in 2022, I turned it all off. 
  Eliminated Twitter trends. Blocked news sites.
  2024 will be the same. Relaxing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620133723996216))
- <a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls">@thepatwalls</a> 14/ Seek
  To better broaden my worldview, I also sought out those who think differently about the world than I do.
  - Different politics
  - Different cultures
  - Different viewpoints
  It was enriching & allowed me to empathize with people I normally wouldn't.
  Conversation > news ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620136618115576))
- <a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls">@thepatwalls</a> 15/ Remember
  In the end, I remembered that life is short.
  Too many days in front of the computer means too few days with my beautiful wife.
  The computer, business, revenue, and social media will always be there.
  Our precious time with loved ones will not.
  Remember that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1743620139595993531))
