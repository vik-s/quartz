## Highlights
- I don't like the idea of finding my niche.
  Because then, I loose the ability to be myself.
  When I lean into being me, I become unique.
  My interests + personality + voice = unique.
  I have 0 competition.
  I can talk about whatever the shit I want.
  Be unique my friends!
  GM! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/erwanlier/status/1710896674887868489))
