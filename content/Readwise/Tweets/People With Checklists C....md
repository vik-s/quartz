## Highlights

  But 99% of them are making their checklists wrong. 
  Here's how to do it right: (Using psychology)

    - Note: Save
- 1. Do a brain dump.
  Write down all tasks in your head.
  All projects, goals, and to-dos.
  This releases cognitive load. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722137584582732))
- 2. Separate tasks.
  Distill it down to 3-5 big tasks for the day.
  Use the Eisenhower Matrix to separate tasks by importance.
  → Urgent and Important
  → Not Urgent, but Important
  → Urgent, but Not Important
  → Not Urgent and Not Important ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722140709315067))
- 3. Create a Morning Routine list.
  Every day, start with a simple 5-15 minute routine.
  Example:
  → Water
  → Breakfast
  → Stretching
  → Plank
  → Meditation
  This helps your brain switch into a productive state. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722143695691954))
- 4. Time Block.
  Schedule time for each task.
  Work for 90 minutes and then take a break.
  Use the Pomodoro Technique.
  25 minute work sprints with 5 minute breaks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722146656813315))
- 5. Connect tasks to goals.
  For each task, ask “Why?”
  Knowing the why behind each task links it to goals.
  Goals = motivation = more productivity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722149638975817))
- 6. Stop overloading your list.
  Busy does not mean productive.
  3-5 major tasks and 1-2 minor tasks are enough.
  This prevents burnout and keeps you motivated. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722152755413433))
- 7. Review your list at the end of the day.
  Look back at completed tasks.
  Celebrate the wins.
  Analyze what was missed.
  This makes the next day's list better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722155741688294))
- Productivity is about focus, not the number of tasks.
  Use these tips for an effective checklist:
  → Brain dump
  → Separate tasks
  → Create a morning routine
  → Time block
  → Connect tasks to goals
  → Stop overloading your list
  → Review at end of day ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722159025811897))
