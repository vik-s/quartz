## Highlights
- Tomorrow is my 103rd consecutive weekly newsletter.
  I’ve spent the last 2 years creating a formula that has helped me write it in 75 minutes or less each week.
  Here's my simple approach (8 steps) to make newsletter creation a bit more simple and predictable.
  Let's Go →
  Step 1: Build An Idea Bank
  The hardest part of writing a weekly newsletter is coming up with topic ideas.
  It’s hugely helpful to capture all your ideas in one place, in real-time as they occur to you.
  So my first tip is to always be building your idea bank.
  I spend a few minutes every day looking for ideas:
  • Scanning YouTube channels
  • Reading aggregator newsletters
  • Surfing relevant news stories or Reddit 
  If you aim to jot down 2-3 new ideas every day, you’ll have 15+ fresh ideas to work with every week. 
  Step 2: Research And Gather Information
  After selecting a topic from your idea bank, it's time to do a little digging.
  Google is your best friend here, and I wouldn’t overcomplicate it.
  Look for a book, tweet, quote, or article that supports your topic idea or offers an interesting perspective.
  Step 3: Use A Template
  This step is my secret sauce for speed - a newsletter template.
  A simple template serves as a roadmap to guide the flow of your newsletter, each and every week.
  Keeping my audience in mind, my newsletter flow is simple:
  1. What's a big problem?
  2. How do most people solve it?
  3. Why doesn't it work for them?
  4. How might I solve it differently?
  5. Recommended action step(s) for readers
  This formula ensures I’m always helping my audience do something they’re struggling to do.
  Step 4: Write Your Headers
  Before you dive into the actual writing, draft your headers.
  These headers will serve as your guideposts. You’re essentially building a mini-outline.
  This basic outline will prevent you from getting off course and help you stick to your critical points.
  I call this step “prepping the page” and it’s been another critical key to my speed.
  Step 5: Fill Out The Body
  Now it's time to flesh out your newsletter.
  Each section should start with an opening line that lays out the intent of the header. What are you about to cover? Prep your reader.
  Follow up with a paragraph about your insights, and then suggest some actionable steps your readers can take.
  This framework ensures you deliver value and tactics your readers can actually use.
  Step 6: Insert Visuals and Research
  Next, incorporate the pieces of research you unearthed earlier.
  If an image or video can support or underscore your points, add those in too.
  Mix it up and keep things interesting for your readers.
  Step 7: Write Your Title
  With your first draft ready, it's time to craft your title.
  A title should be catchy and bold. And it should clearly tell the reader what to expect inside.
  An email subject line tester can help you gauge the strength of your title.
  Tweak your title until it's enticing enough to generate good open rates.
  Step 8: Edit Using a Process
  Lastly, it’s important to put your newsletter through an editing process.
  Here are the 4 simple questions I scan for when I edit a newsletter:
  1. Are my sentences easy to understand?
  2. Do I go on any tangents that could be eliminated?
  3. Did I add links to relevant resources?
  4. Do I deliver what I promised in my headline?
  In Summary:
  Writing a weekly newsletter can feel really difficult.
  But breaking it down into manageable steps makes it not just possible, but actually efficient and enjoyable.
  The best part about a newsletter is that you can transform it into 6-12 pieces of content using a simple system.
  2 birds. 1 stone.
