  Take every piece of advice here with a grain of salt.
  I'm just some random guy on the internet sharing what I've learned on my very specific journey, so it might not translate 100% for you.
  But, if there is one takeaway, it's this:** Get started.**
  That's how you'll figure out your own journey.
  I hope this list helps you avoid some of the mistakes I made over the last 4 years.

- You can go from $0 to $100k in one year on X.
  - No career path
  - No daily meetings
  - No "Can I have a raise?"
  - No performance reviews
  - No, "the big boss says no"
  Just heads down for 12 months.
  A predictable system. 
  And uncapped earning potential. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1703016715158778164))
- Something I can't stop thinking about:
  We all have knowledge, skills, and experience.
  But we're so convinced that our knowledge is as common as knowing how to tie your shoes.
  It isn't.
  I've seen thousands of people trying to learn things that so many of us take for granted.
  For example, I think creating simple systems to work with my VA (virtual assistant) is as common as they come.
  But, when I shared a Tweet and newsletter about how I built them, people were floored.
  This whole phenomenon of thinking our knowledge is common is called, Knowledge Blindness.
  And trust me — you’re likely suffering from it.
  So here’s an exercise I'd recommend:
  Take 30 minutes today to list out what you consider to be your basic skills.
  - What have you learned at work?
  - What hobby are you excellent at?
  - What do family & friends come to you for?
  Brain dump everything you can think of.
  Then, hop on social media. Search around.
  Is anyone asking about these things?
  Try using Advanced X search and typing in “does anyone know how to” and then adding a keyword like "newsletter" or "SEO".
  You'll likely find people struggling with something you excel at. That's your cue.
  Once you've identified a "basic" skill people want to learn, draft up 10-15 pieces of content that show your expertise.
  For example, the other day on LinkedIn, I shared a long post about the different types of website traffic and how to get some: Direct, organic, social, etc.
  In my mind, this is the most basic information in the world.
  Everyone probably knows this stuff — right?
  Well, it turns out that 121,144 people found it useful enough to read and 800+ of them signed up for my newsletter.
  If I wanted, I could likely build a low-cost product that helped people increase their web traffic.
  If your content starts getting some traction, consider stepping it up another notch.
  Create a one-pager or a video explaining the basics of your skill. Turn it into a lead magnet that people can access.
  You’ll start to collect email addresses of people who could be your ideal customers.
  **Here's the most important step:**
  Once they’ve accessed it, send them an automated email and ask them what their 3 biggest challenges are related to your skill or knowledge.
  Pipe those answers into AirTable, Google Sheets, or Notion using Zapier.
  **↑ NOBODY does this ↑**
  These answers can become content, newsletters, products, etc. There’s so much gold in this information!
  Hope this gives you something to think about this week.
  Drop any questions you have below and I’ll do my best to answer today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1703798560968347684))
- Offer stack for a $115,000 business:
  - $99 course x 2 per day = $72.3k
  - $350 coaching x 2 per week = $36.4k
  - $125 newsletter sponsors x 52 = $6.5k
  Could probably build this with ~10,000 interested followers and ~5,000 newsletter subs.
