## Highlights
- Imagine this:
  1. You get home from work at 5:10pm every day.
  2. You do not check email after 4:59pm.
  3. You do not worry about a single thing until 9:01 am the next morning.
  4. Every single stressful problem simply gets passed on to someone else.
  5. You’ve never had to fire somebody in your life.
  6. If the company loses money because of something you did, your paycheck doesn’t change.
  7. You know exactly how much money will hit your bank account every other Friday.
  8. When you’re on vacation for a week, nobody can reach you and you do not bring your computer.
  9. Your phone NEVER rings outside of business hours.
  10. If you lose your job, you could make a few phone calls and likely have an offer for more $.
  This is what 99% of jobs in the USA are like. 
  Being an employee is the correct path for almost all humans.
  Entrepreneurs are underpaid for the stress they endure and the value they create for so many of their employees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1725483301660455305))

- I'm hosting a free online workshop next week on the most important aspect of business:
  Hiring and delegation.
  A cold hard fact:
  If you can hire and manage other humans you can get very wealthy in this world.
  If you can do your job well you can make good money. If you can set up other people to do their jobs well, you can get rich.
