    - Note: Save
- First, there are 3 ways to monetize your newsletter:
  â€¢ Affiliate - Promote someone else's product, get paid when someone buys / signs up
  â€¢ Sponsorships - Promote someone else's product, get paid for the promotion
  â€¢ Owned Products - Build and sell your product or service ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964042929312202))
- All of these can be great.
  But each has pros and cons!
  Plus, each varies in the amount of work, risk, and financial reward.
  Hereâ€™s what I mean: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964045911454072))

- All of these monetization options work great IF done well.
  Butâ€¦
  â€¢ When should you start?
  â€¢ Which should you start with?
  â€¢ How do you make your first $10k? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964079772008853))
- When To Start Monetizing
  Monetize your newsletter from day 1.
  If you want to build a newsletter business, you need revenue.
  Donâ€™t try and build an audience then find ways to make money later.
  Hereâ€™s how to get started: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964082674507810))
- Affiliate Marketing The Easiest Way To Start
  The best affiliate offers for newsletters are OTHER newsletters.
  (If someone joined your newsletter, theyâ€™re probably interested in other newsletters too.)
  Use these 3 networks to get paid to send subscribers to other newsletters:

- With beehiiv boosts or SparkLoop, you can earn ~$1-$2 (or more) when someone subscribes to your newsletter.
  That means:
  â€¢ 100 subscribers per month = $100-$200 in revenue
  â€¢ 1,000 subscribers per month = $1k-$2k in revenue
  â€¢ 10k subscribers per month = $10k-$20k in revenue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964095123177807))
- This is the best way to start monetizing...
  But it should NOT be your only revenue stream.
  After your newsletter gains some traction (1k-5k subscribers) you need to think about your long-term monetization strategy.
  This will likely be sponsorships and/or owned products. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964098155639139))
- When To Build Your Product
  Think about this as soon as your newsletter gains traction.
  If you have a product/service from day 1, thatâ€™s even better.
  You donâ€™t need to wait until you have 10k+ subscribers to sell something.
  The earlier the better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964101183914023))
- What Type of Product Is Best?
  Thereâ€™s no perfect answer.
  The best answer is to build what you want to buy -- or the type of product youâ€™re already buying!
  As it relates to your newsletter topic:
  â€¢ What are you spending money on?
  â€¢ What products have you bought and loved? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964104187052470))
- The 10 Best Product Types For Newsletters
  Here are some ideas:
  â€¢ Job boards
  â€¢ Mastermind
  â€¢ Membership
  â€¢ Paid newsletter
  â€¢ Paid community
  â€¢ Live and online events
  â€¢ Coaching and/or consulting
  â€¢ Agency and/or productized service
  â€¢ Courses (On-demand or Cohort based) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964107093701051))
- When To Start Selling Sponsorships
  Most advertisers won't sponsor until you have 5k-10k+ engaged subscribers.
  Once you reach that threshold you should:
  â€¢ Create a simple media kit (20+ examples on my website)
  â€¢ Develop your inbound and outbound sales strategy
  Here's how: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964110096838662))
- The 2 primary ways to sell ads:
  1) Inbound sales - Sell sponsorships to your existing audience.
  Let people know about sponsorships in your newsletter, your website, and socials.
  2) Outbound sales - Reach out to advertisers who are sponsoring other newsletters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964112978305444))
- The Math Behind Your First $10k
  If you...
  â€¢ Add 20 subs a day for 3 months = 1,800 subs
  â€¢ Convert 3% of subs to a $99 product = $5,346
  â€¢ Earn $2 per sub from Boosts/Sparkloop = $3,600
  â€¢ Convert 0.5% of subs to a $250 coaching call = $2,250
  Total = $11,196 in revenue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964115884994620))
- That's doable with a weekly newsletter you build as a side hustle.
  Plus, your total expenses will be <$150 per month.
  Now what happens when you grow your newsletter to 10k+ subscribers?
  Here's how BIG newsletters can get: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964119068528965))
- With 10k subs, if you...
  â€¢ Sell 1 sponsorship per week at $300 = $15,600
  â€¢ Convert 3% of subs to a $99 product = $29,700
  â€¢ Earn $2 per sub from Boosts/Sparkloop = $20,000
  â€¢ Convert 0.5% of subs to a $250 coaching call = $12,500
  Total = $77,800 in revenue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964121979261394))
- If you have 10k subscribers, you'll never be poor.
  And no one can take those subscribers away from you!
  (Unlike your audience on Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, etc).
  Plus, it's not that hard:
  â€¢ 28 subs a day = 10k+ subs in 1 year
  â€¢ 83 subs a day = 10k+ subs in 4 months ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964124877631817))
- Plus, there's a path to get acquired...
  Industry Dive was acquired for $525M in 10 years.
  MorningBrew was acquired for $75M in 5 years.
  The Hustle was acquired for $27M in 4 years.
  The Peak was acquired for $5M in 3 years.
  Milk Road sold for 7 figures in 10 months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JMatthewMcGarry/status/1772964127742349537))
