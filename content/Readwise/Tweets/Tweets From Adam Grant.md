## Highlights
- How to give feedback without being a jerk:
  1. Be a coach, not a critic. Aim to help, not attack.
  2. Don't assert opinion as fact. You're sharing your subjective reaction, not the objective truth.
  3. Be honest, not brutal. Be direct in what you say, but kind in how you say it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1725574310654357860))
