## Highlights
- How to give feedback without being a jerk:
  1. Be a coach, not a critic. Aim to help, not attack.
  2. Don't assert opinion as fact. You're sharing your subjective reaction, not the objective truth.
  3. Be honest, not brutal. Be direct in what you say, but kind in how you say it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1725574310654357860))

- There's no such thing as an ideal daily routine. The best model is the one that works for you.
  Successful people don't keep similar schedules. Their common practice is experimenting to learn what suits them.
  Don't be a slave to others' habits. One size doesn't fit all minds.
