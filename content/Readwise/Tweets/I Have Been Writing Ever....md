## Highlights
- I have been writing every day on the Internet for 10+ years.
  I'm convinced it's the foundation for every type of creative work:
  â€¢ Video-making
  â€¢ Storytelling
  â€¢ Podcasting
  â€¢ Marketing
  â€¢ Selling
  Here are 9 dead-simple steps to build a daily writing habit you can stick with: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737276434071968))
    - Note: Save
- 1. Make time to write.
  You don't "find" time to:
  â€¢ Go to the gym
  â€¢ See your old friend from college
  â€¢ Visit your parents on Christmas Day
  When something matters, you MAKE the time.
  So that's what you need to do to build a sustainable daily writing habit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737289369387435))
- 2. Go for walks every day.
  The best authors and copywriters in the world talk about long walks.
  â€¢ Thinking
  â€¢ Observing
  â€¢ Brainstorming
  Let your mind wander and capture ideas as they pop up.
  Youâ€™ll be amazed (and want to start doing it every day). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737294670999900))
- 3. Create an idea capture system.
  It's critical to write down ideas the second inspiration strikes.
  Keep:
  â€¢ Post-it notesâ€‹ by your bed.
  â€¢ A quick capture app on your phone.
  â€¢ A waterproof whiteboard in the shower.
  Relying on your memory is a recipe for disaster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737299364335650))
- 4. Create an idea generation system.
  With your idea capture system set up, itâ€™s time to start generating ideas.
  â€‹To help you do this, hereâ€™s a deep dive on the Endless Idea Generator ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737307321028636))
- 5. Set your creative constraints.
  For example:
  Platform: Choose 1.
  Time: Limit of 30 minutes.
  Topic: Anything thatâ€™s sustainable for you.
  Length: Long form, short form, tweets, blog posts, etc.
  These stop you from overthinking, over-editing, and falling out of practice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737313486630947))
- 6. Evening brain dumps.
  â€¢ Write down 1 idea thatâ€™s top of mind
  â€¢ Brain dump 10 bullet points on that idea (without judgment)
  â€¢ Close your journal and go to bed
  And just like that, tomorrowâ€™s writing process has begun.
  Give it a try and watch your creativity thrive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737317223666110))
- 7. Design your creative environment for focus.
  We all have a never-ending stream of distractions.
  Here's what I recommend:
  â€¢ â€‹Cold-turkey app blocker
  â€‹â€¢ Noise-canceling headphones
  â€¢ Put your phone in another room
  And just like that, you've eliminated the outside world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737321854177623))
- 8. Start transcribing your voice (to demolish writerâ€™s block).
  My go-to hack is to use a voice transcription service for recording ideas.
  â€¢ Go for a walk.
  â€¢ Talk through your ideas.
  â€¢ Transcribe it.
  This transcription is now your working outline.
  Boom!
  No more blank page. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737326946087287))
- 9. Track your streak.
  Remember, humans are dopamine chasers.
  So, every time you complete a writing session, reward yourself.
  â€¢ Write every day.
  â€¢ Print out a big calendar.
  â€¢ Mark a big red X after each session.
  Make it all the way to 30 days and watch everything change. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1748737330083492047))
- Boom! 
  Here's a recap:
  â€¢ Make time to write
  â€¢ Walk more
  â€¢ Create an idea capture system
  â€¢ Build an idea generation system
  â€¢ Set creative constraints
  â€¢ End your day with a brain dump
  â€¢ Craft your creative environment
