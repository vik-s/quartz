- Most people are terrified of creating content.
  I've literally had multiple execs say to me "it's as daunting as skydiving." A tad dramatic, but I totally get it. 
  So I created THE NICHE BUILDER, which is a simple 10-question quiz that helps anyone create their content strategy in <15 minutes. 
  We developed this tool at [storyarb](https://twitter.com/storyarb)[.]com and use it for all of our subscribers to support everything from exec social to company social to newsletters.
