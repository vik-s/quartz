## Highlights
- I studied the writing routine of 500 legendary writers.
  Turns out, great writing is simple—if you do these 6 things every day: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620538513825792))
    - Note: Save
- 1. Take long walks
  For each of these legends, daily walks were the *staple* of their creative process.
  • Thinking
  • Listening
  • Outlining
  • Observing
  95% of their writing happened during long walks.
  By the time they sat down to type, they knew exactly what to say. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620543534407680))
- 2. Capture ideas—everywhere
  The world's biggest lie:
  "I'll remember that idea later."
  Each of these great writers treated every idea as *precious* and captured it immediately.
  • Quick capture on their phone
  • Whiteboards in the shower
  • Notebooks all over the place ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620548500455426))
- These first 2 daily habits made coming up with ideas *easy* — something that happened with zero effort.
  By simply going about their day, their brain was free to think creatively.
  Staring at a blank page?
  Never a problem for them.
  Now, onto their daily writing routines: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620553495842817))
- 3. Write on a timer—every day
  Jerry Seinfeld—a billion-dollar comedian.
  Gary Halbert—a billion-dollar copywriter.
  Both of these legends had a simple routine with 1 rule.
  1. Set a timer for 33:33
  2. During that time, you could do anything except get out of your chair

- And this took the pressure off writing.
  For the first few minutes, they would stare at the wall.
  Sip their coffee.
  Think about all the other thing they would rather be doing.
  But at some point, they'd start writing.
  And the timer let they know the torture would end soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620566779142145))
- During their breaks, they would walk around, have a quick snack, and do anything else but write.
  And during this time, inspiration always struck.
  Then, at the end of the day, they wouldn't say "I wrote until I got tired."
  They would say "I wrote for six sessions today." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620571745296385))
- This made it easy to keep momentum.
  The timer made it easy to get started, and the daily recap made them feel a sense of accomplishment.
  Day by day, these sessions compounded.
  But aside from the timer, there was one more common trait: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620576728137729))
- 4. Ruthlessly block distractions
  95% of writing is simply avoiding the internet's distractions.
  So these writers would go a long way to isolate themselves from the notifications, pings, and interruptions.
  • Secluded hotels
  • Cabins in the woods
  Anything to avoid the noise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620581648011265))
- So far we've talked about:
  1. Taking long walks
  2. Capturing ideas everywhere
  3. Writing on a timer
  4. Avoiding distractions
  These are enough for any beginner to get started.
  But it's the last 2 steps that turn *average* writing into *legendary* writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620586613997568))
- 5. Be 100% content to appear clueless.
  Each of these writers had a complete lack of ego.
  They were endlessly curious—never afraid to ask "stupid" questions.
  This made them learning machines, always inhaling new information.
  And you *felt* this curiosity in their writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620591739736064))
- Without an ego, these writers would dive head first into any new topic as a complete beginner.
  By learning and studying different topics & fields, they could combine ideas in a way no one else could.
  The smaller the ego, the better the writer.
  Which takes us to the 6th step: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620596844007425))
- 6. Constantly seek objective feedback
  Most writers never hit publish because they're a "perfectionist."
  But perfectionism is 100% an ego problem.
  You are you assuming people are going to comb your every word, waiting for mistakes.
  Newsflash: they aren't.
  Instead, do this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620601881333760))
- • Hit publish before it's ready
  The truth is, your writing will never be ready.
  So get it out into the world.
  Then, listen carefully to what your readers have to say.
  • Don't ask for feedback—ask for advice
  People are uncomfortable giving feedback, so ask for it like this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620606843195398))
- When getting advice (instead of feedback), Tim Ferriss requests the reader highlight:
  • Anywhere boring
  • Anything confusing
  • Anywhere your mind starts to wander
  Then he asks two questions - what is the:
  • 10% I must keep
  • 20% I should cut immediately ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620611775651848))
- Boom – that's it!
  And here's the 1 big realization you should have from this thread:
  The best writing is not a result.
  It's a byproduct.
  By carefully crafting (and following) a daily writing system, great writing is guaranteed.
  And these legends provide the best example! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1552620616750186496))
- In summary, to be a great writer, do these 6 things every day:
  1. Take long walks
  2. Capture ideas everywhere
  3. Write on a timer—every day
  4. Ruthlessly avoid distractions
  5. Be 100% content to appear clueless
  6. Seek feedback objectively
