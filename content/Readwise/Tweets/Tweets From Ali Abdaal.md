## Highlights
- Everyone dreams about working for themselves while living anywhere in the world 🌏
  Here’s a 3-step process to turn your dream into a reality:
  🔑 The Key Ingredient:
  Money 💰
  To be able to live anywhere you want in the world, you need to figure out a way to make money to afford that.
  To work for yourself from wherever you want in the world (aka be a digital nomad), there are typically 3 paths you can take:
  Path 1: The creator 🎥
  Although I’m a creator myself, this path is the one I recommend the least if you want to be a digital nomad.
  I say that because being a creator is more of a long-term game that takes time for you to start making money through things like:
  👉 Adsense
  👉 Affiliate links
  👉 Sponsorship deals
  So, although you can become a digital nomad while being a creator, I recommend one of the other 2 paths I’ll show you below.
  Path 2: The entrepreneur 👨‍💼
  Being an entrepreneur is another path you can take to become a digital nomad.
  For example, my brother is taking this path as he started a tech company (which has been valued at $100 million).
  Although he works from anywhere he wants, building a start-up can be difficult as a digital nomad because it requires a lot of long hours & meetings with investors & business partners.
  This is why the 3rd path I’m going to show you is the 1 I recommend the most.
  Path 3: The remote freelancer 👨‍💻
  I recommend this path the most because you can start making money with it quite quickly.
  To be a remote freelancer, you need 2 things:
  👉 A skill
  👉 Clients to pay you for that skill
  If you have a job, you might already have skills that you can use to do this.
  After you’ve learned a skill (or if you already have 1), you need clients to pay you for that skill.
  To find clients, you can go through one of the basic websites like:
  👉 Fiverr
  👉 Upwork
  👉 PeoplePerHour
  But I recommend doing it a different way
  👉 Target creators
  👉 Target boring businesses
  To target either of these, you must make yourself findable. Create a:
  👉 Twitter account
  👉 LinkedIn account
  👉 Personal website
  You want the people you’re targeting to trust you & your service.
  Once you get your first client doing this, ensure you get the most out of them.
  Get them great results, then ask them for testimonials & word of mouth recommendations to other business owners.
  This 1st client will typically be how you get your next client and so on.
  If you’re interested in doing this, but you have a full-time job, don’t worry, it’s still possible.
  I used nights and weekends to build my YouTube channel while working as a doctor.
  You just have to be smart & intentional with your time.
