## Highlights
- I realize now that a lot of my side projects, back when I had a full-time job, failed simply because I did not have the right attitude about them.
  When things are done for commercial activity, to make money, you need to have a certain ruthless attitude. 
  This side project is not your life’s work. This is a way to make money. 
  And this was my mistake: I always thought about how big it could get, how cool the idea was, and so on.
  Your project could maybe (MAYBE!) become something bigger, but only if it’s working & making money. If it’s not making money, then it’s worthless. And why would you make something worthless your life’s work? You wouldn’t.
  In small bets, Daniel likes to say, “Treat your projects like Cattle, not Pets.” 
  There is nothing wrong with having pets. But you learn a lot more with Cattle, with people actually paying you something. 
  And if you’d like to use your projects to get out of full-time employment, or make your life more resilient to layoffs, it’s much more likely to work if you change your attitude about your projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1758225787587539023))
