## Highlights
- Every writer has a slightly different process, but they all start with the same thing: a blank page. 
  Even if you don’t consider yourself a writer (I never did), putting thoughts on paper is the best way to A) develop ideas, and B) review and improve your thinking. 
  The benefits of even 30 minutes a week of scribbling can transfer to everything else that you do. 
  The following bullets are writing prompts that Cheryl Strayed (@CherylStrayed) has suggested when asked for assignment ideas for students who’ve read Wild.
  They are brilliant and make fantastic jumping-off points for any type of journaling or writing, whether Morning Pages, a blog post, the beginning of a novel, a letter to a friend, a diary entry, a screenplay, or a too-fast-too-soon Tinder message. 
  Try one for two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and don’t stop to edit. Step one is to generate without judging. Chances are that you’ll surprise yourself. 
  Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken. 
  Write about a lesson you learned the hard way. 
  Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion. 
  Write about something you lost that you’ll never get back. 
  Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing. 
  Write about something you don’t remember. 
  Write about your darkest teacher. 
  Write about a memory of a physical injury. 
  Write about when you knew it was over. 
  Write about being loved. 
  Write about what you were really thinking. 
  Write about how you found your way back. 
  Write about the kindness of strangers. 
  Write about why you could not do it. 
  Write about why you did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1714592949290389521))
