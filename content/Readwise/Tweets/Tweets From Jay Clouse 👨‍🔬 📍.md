## Highlights
- Ever wonder why some accounts seem to blow up overnight?
  Let me introduce you to **the pendulum**.
  Things come into style and things go out of style. It's true for fashion, baby names, and even content creation.
  Before Casey Neistat, daily vlogging on YouTube wasn't popular. As Casey made daily vlogging interesting, more and more people began making their own vlogs!
  MrBeast pioneered the large-scale, game show spectacle. As he grew, tons of channels began mimicking that format ‚Äì they even mimicked his open-mouthed thumbnail style!
  Fast forward a few years, and people are now asking, "What is the new meta on YouTube?" Is it Sam Sulek-style, lightly-edited, long-form vlogs again? I don't think so, but time will tell.
  Everything that becomes popular was pioneered by someone before it was popular. And everything that becomes popular eventually becomes stale and unpopular, too.
  Trends are like a **pendulum**. The pendulum itself represents the culture's collective attention and it swings from one extreme to another. As it swings closer to one end of the spectrum, it picks up speed and momentum ‚Äì but it has a limit.
  At some point, the pendulum swings in the opposite direction. What was cool becomes uncool, and what was uncool becomes cool (and back and forth and back and forth).
  The pendulum is a powerful force. Y**ou want to be just ahead of the pendulum.** You want to be ahead of the culture in identifying a different approach so that you feel momentum at your back as the culture catches up.
  When you're ahead of the pendulum, you feel it. More and more people want to consume this type of content, so you start getting more attention than before for the same effort.
  You can only get ahead of the pendulum by innovating. You have to ‚Äãexperiment‚Äã with new styles and approaches ‚Äì which may fall flat.
  Tim Urban caught the wave of early Facebook ads.
  Sahil Bloom was early to using Threads.
  Dan Koe began publishing his black and white animations to Reels in Dec. 2022 (check out Social Blade for what happened next).
  **The pendulum is a kingmaker.**
  On a subconscious level, you know that you need to be ahead of the trend to reap the benefits. But most of us are risk-averse. So instead of innovating, we try and identify what others are doing that is "working" and emulate them.
  If your eyes are open and you identify a trend early, this can work. But catching a trend may be more difficult than starting one ‚Äì because **catching a trend requires precise timing**. Precise timing doesn't just mean implementing a new format, it requires implementing a new format WELL.
  **Most creators are stuck behind the pendulum. **They're constantly following trends and by the time they're able to execute well, the pendulum has already swung back.
  **When you're chasing the pendulum, your work feels derivative.** Instead of getting more attention for the same effort, you start getting less.
  Being aware of the pendulum makes it tempting to try and play the timing game. It feels like you have a secret that can help you get a leg up!
  When you're early to a trend, more people will see your work than would otherwise...but that doesn't matter if they're ‚Äãindifferent‚Äã to it. You need good timing AND engaging content for being ahead of the pendulum to matter ‚Äì and that's really why innovating is a better strategy than trend-chasing.
  Innovation happens far away from the pendulum. When you're truly innovating, you don't know if it will work out. All you know is that the thing you're currently doing is NOT the current "hot" thing.
  But when you're innovating long before the pendulum swings in your direction, you have the opportunity to get GOOD at the format (better than everyone else).
  **Magic happens when:**
  1. You're doing great work
  2. In an innovative format
  3. Just ahead of the pendulum
  Ingredients 1 and 2 have an unpredictable lead time. So you have to run away from the pendulum to buy yourself as much time as possible in case things start swinging your way.
  Some will call it ‚Äãluck‚Äã ‚Äì but it will be luck you manufactured.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GF1FZ5_XgAA44vD.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1755642075964383723))
