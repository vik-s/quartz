## Highlights
- Kill your “dependencies.”
  • I have to do X before I work
  • If I don’t get my Y, the day is ruined
  • I couldn’t possibly work out without Z
  These “routines” are invisible chains that crush your resilience.
  Shed them so you can progress no matter the conditions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1708098449646735455))
