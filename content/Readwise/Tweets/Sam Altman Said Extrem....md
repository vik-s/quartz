## Highlights
- Sam Altman said: "extreme people get extreme results"
  Do ordinary people get extreme results? (eg. Lottery winners is one example.. others?) 
  And more importantly, do most extreme people (say, 90%+) get extreme results? 
  I suspect so.. 
  But it depends on what you call "extreme". For example, I don't believe working very hard, or having extreme work ethic gets you extreme results (eg. the hard working landscaper or janitor)
  To me - an 'extreme person' is extreme in how deep they believe in something, or desire something. (eg. the guy who deeply wants to 'make it' in hollywood)
  Extreme belief creates massive action, massive action creates inevitable results. And results make them say "see, I knew it" (self fulfilling prophecy)
  It also works in the negative. Extreme love becomes stalking. Extreme religious beliefs can convince someone to kill in the name of their religion. 
  I'm sure there are outliers, but I think the line holds true: 
  Extreme people get extreme results. 
  So how can I use this? 
  It gives you a new strategy. Instead of trying to become an expert in any specific thing -- I can just learn the skill of being more extreme.
  Even if he does not know the way - the extreme man will find the way. 
  When <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseItzler">@JesseItzler</a> wanted to get in the best shape of his life to run an Ultraman - he took an extreme step. He hired <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgoggins">@davidgoggins</a> to come live with him in his house for 30 days, and agreed to do whatever he said - training day and night. (fun book btw. "living with a seal) 
  Next time I want something, my first question will be: what would an extreme person do here? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1734084508570575305))
