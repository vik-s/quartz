## Highlights
- A monthly ritual that changed my life.
  The Think Day
  (bookmark this and try it later)
  In the 1980s, Bill Gates began an annual tradition he called the Think Week.
  Gates would seclude himself in a remote location, shut off communication, and spend a week dedicated to reading and thinking.
  The radical approach became essential to his process:
  "Think Week is a time when I can be creative and push my own thinking. It's a time to step outside the day-to-day demands of my job and really focus on the big picture." - Bill Gates
  I first read about the Think Week a few years ago and knew I wanted to give it a shot.
  I didn't have an entire week to dedicate to it (early career demands, family priorities, etc.), but figured I could adapt something with a similar core vision.
  The Think Day was my creation:
  Pick one day each month to step back from all of your day-to-day professional demands:
  • Seclude yourself (mentally or physically).
  • Shut off all of your devices.
  • Put up an out-of-office response.
  The goal: Spend the entire day reading, learning, journaling, and THINKING.
  By doing this, you create the free time to zoom out, open your mind, and think creatively about the bigger picture.
  My essential tools for Think Day:
  • Journal and pen.
  • Books/articles I've been wanting to read.
  • Secluded location (at home, rental, or outside).
  • Thinking prompts to spark my mind.
  Six thinking prompts I've found particularly useful:
  1. Are you hunting antelope (big important problems) or field mice (small urgent problems)?
  2. How can you do less, but better?
  3. What are your strongest beliefs? What would it take for you to change your mind on them?
  4. What are a few things that you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago?
  5. What actions were you engaged in 5 years ago that you cringe at today? What actions are you engaged in today that you will cringe at in 5 years?
  6. What would your 80-year-old self say about your decisions today?
  I aim for an 8-hour window split into 60-minute focus blocks with walks in between.
  You have to slow down to speed up.
  In a speed-obsessed world, the benefits of slowing down are extensive:
  • Restore energy
  • Notice things you missed
  • Be more deliberate with actions
  • Focus on the highest leverage opportunities
  • Move slow to move fast.
  The Think Day can help. Give it a shot and let me know what you think.
