## Highlights
- I run a 6,000 subs newsletter as a side hustle
  Here are 3 mistakes I'm making with it right now and how I plan to fix them:
  **Mistakes I'm making**
  ***#1 - No core paid offer***
  The newsletter has helped me sell around $25,000 worth of digital products for the past few years.
  The problem? 
  These have been all one-off launches. 
  There hasn't been any continuity in my offerings because I lack a core offer.
  ***The fix***
  Working on a core offer ➝ I've decided to compile all the tactics I've ever shared in my newsletter (over 100+ now) into a searchable database.
  I launched a v1 of the product in late 2023 and made $3,000. 
  Product validated ✅
  We are putting the final touches on the new version, which will be ready by EOM.
  ***#2 - No selling systems in place***
  Here's the only automation that's running on my newsletter right now: a welcome email
  That's a missed opportunity.
  I don't even have a welcome sequence (sorry [HeyJeffFelten](https://twitter.com/HeyJeffFelten)) 
  ***The fix***
  Once the product is done, I'll build a welcome sequence to pitch it to every new sub.
  I'll also include a bit of personalization (from the answers I get from a post-sub survey) so the conversion hopefully increases.
  I already have the bones. I need to finish the product first.
  ***#3 - No growth engine in place***
  Right now, the newsletter is solely growing based on word of mouth and a few mentions on social media.
  That's not enough.
  A few months back I realized I wasn't putting effort into the growth side because I didn't see a point in doing it without a core offer.
  Now that's getting fixed, it's time to kickstart the growth engine.
  ***The fix***
  I'm excited to try out a few different channels:
  - Side project marketing (thanks to [DanKulkov](https://twitter.com/DanKulkov) for the inspiration)
  - Paid growth in platforms like Boosts or Sparkloop
  - Lead magnets
  - Affiliates
  That's it.
  Why am I sharing this?
  This is just to show the thought process behind a side project like mine. 
  Hopefully, it will help and inspire others. More build in public from me from now on! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexLlullTW/status/1767567209679704285))
