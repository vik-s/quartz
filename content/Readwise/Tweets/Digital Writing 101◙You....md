## Highlights
- Digital Writing 101
  You’re playing a game.
  It’s called Catch Their Attention.
  Here are 7 fundamental rules you should live by if you want to be a successful Digital Writer: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194395672248411))
    - Note: Save
- Rule #1: Don’t Start A Blog
  The game of Digital Writing, in a nutshell:
  • Write where readers already are (social media, etc.)
  • Publish often
  • See what sticks
  ​• Own a niche
  The biggest mistake you can make is starting a blog, because nobody knows your blog exists. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194400516780272))
- Rule #2: Start Before You’re Ready
  Everyone wants to wait until they know where they’re headed before they set sail.
  • You “assume” you know what you wanna write about
  • You “assume” you know what the reader wants to read about from you
  News flash: You don't. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194402605441253))
- Rule #3: Publish Every Day
  I hear the same things when people consistently press send:
  • “Someone read my essay and just offered me a job.”
  • “I just landed a client because she loved something I wrote.”
  But the world has to be able to read your work to reward you for it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194408934695072))
- Rule #4: Prep With Templates
  People struggle to start writing because they're afraid of the blank page.
  • Should they create an outline?
  • Should they just start picking random words?
  • Should they edit as they go?
  None of these are right.
  Start with a template. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194410994160083))
- Rule #5: Treat Your Writing Like A Startup
  • Start small
  • Double-down on "what works"
  • Expand “what’s working” into more of “what’s working”
  Don’t say “I want to write a best-selling book.”
  Start small. Gather data. Listen to your readers.
  Then expand on it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194422146810004))
- Rule #6: Start With Quantity Over Quality
  In the digital world, volume wins.
  • Readers want content.
  • Algorithms want content.
  More data points mean more opportunities to learn.
  The more you learn, the faster you grow, and the wider your reach becomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194424348774612))
- Rule #7: Realize Perfectionism Is An Ego Problem
  You don’t have to be writing books in order to experience the benefits of writing.
  Just write:
  • X Long-Form
  • LinkedIn posts
  • Newsletters
  It's the best time in history to be a writer.
  As long as it's a Digital Writer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1717194426504597547))
