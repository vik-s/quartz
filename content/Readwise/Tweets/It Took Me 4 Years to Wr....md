## Highlights
- It took me 4 years to write my 1st book.
  And it took me 4 months to write my 2nd book.
  Now, I can write a 60,000 word book in 30 days.
  Here's the framework:
  1. Your book's Main Title/Subtitle is 80% of the work.
  • What question (of the reader's) are you answering?
  • What problem are you solving?
  • What solution are you unlocking?
  • How are you going to get there?
  Don't start writing till you can answer these 4 questions.
  2. Make a list of all the Main Points you want to make in your book.
  Again, don't start writing yet.
  List out:
  • The big ideas that matter most
  • And decide in what order
  If you can do this, with clarity, your book is 90% done.
  3. Under each Main Point, list out all the little sub-points.
  Again, don't start writing yet.
  Keep listing:
  • What smaller ideas do you want to include?
  • What examples?
  • What insights?
  • What stories?
  Do this, and your book is 95% done.
  4. Now just go down your list of Main Points, section by section.
  All your sub-points are your "notes" of what to write about.
  This makes the writing 100x easier.
  Because you literally have the words right in front of you.
  "Say this here."
  Now you're 99% done.
  5. Do a final spelling/grammar read through.
  Since you took the time to organize all your thoughts FIRST, by the time you "finish writing," you're done.
  Give your book a once-over for spelling/grammar.
  And you're 100% done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1714975200075284737))
