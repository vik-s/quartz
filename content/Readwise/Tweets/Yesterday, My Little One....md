## Highlights
- Yesterday, my little one-person business crossed $4M in revenue.
  It took 1,352 days, I ran zero ads & operate at a 94% margin.
  Here are the 20 steps of my wild & strange journey:
  Hope it's helpful to someone.

- 1/ Created lots of noise
  When I was just getting started, I looked at attention as my friend.
  I wrote content every day before I even had a business, just to find my voice.
  I started on LinkedIn.
  I shared my thoughts & observations about building a SaaS unicorn as the CRO. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619397558312960))
- 2/ Honed in on signals
  Inside all of that noise? Signal.
  Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.
  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down. 
  This allowed me to understand what people cared about.
  So, I kept writing & talking about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619399793975296))
- 3/ Built a service business
  My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.
  Founders sent me DMs asking questions. 
  I responded to every single one.
  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619401601732608))
- 4/ Found my ideal customers
  Inside your customer base is more signals.
  What are the commonalities between the customers you love & those who love you?
  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in & loved.
  That became my ideal customer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619403908579328))
- 5/ 2x'ed my rates
  With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.
  I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.
  I said no to any company outside of my niche. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619406018322432))
- 6/ Reduced my time
  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much. 
  Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.
  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale income that was more automated.
  My goal had always been to get my time back. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619408404824064))
- 7/ Kept my eyes and ears open
  Something really interesting happened.
  In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.
  I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn itself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619410359418882))
- 8/ Tested a hypothesis
  Back then, I had grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn & people wanted to know more.
  I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create & sell.
  I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) & wrote posts about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619412678778882))
- 9/ Made my first product $$
  I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020. 
  In the first month, I made $10,482. 
  I was shocked.
  I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.
  Honestly, this confused me. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619414578896902))
- 10/ Ran with it
  Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.
  I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)
  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619416453652484))
- 11/ Tripled down
  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.
  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.
  The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".
  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619418328608768))
- 12/ Marketed aggressively
  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.
  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.
  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.
  Next up... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619420329291778))
- 13/ I began creating an army
  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial & sign up for an affiliate program.
  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.
  I now have 1,400+ affiliates that have generated $280,000+ in revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619422388633603))
- 14/ Built a community
  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.
  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.
  I opened a private community for creators and charged $199. 
  Those who completed my course were prompted to join. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619429456105472))
- 15/ Made a difficult decision
  I loved my community but realized that it didn't work with my personality.
  It was a $15k MRR business, but I felt like I had to be "on" 24/7.
  That wasn't the life I wanted to build.
  15 months after starting it, I made a decision to shut it down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619431314087936))
- 16/ Reinvested my time
  With way more free time now, I decided to start Tweeting.
  Using what I knew about growing on LinkedIn, I was able to hit 75k followers in about 6 months.
  This provided a new channel to build more stuff.
  So I did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619433230868483))
- 17/ Created a 2nd digital course
  I was doing a podcast with @dickiebush and @nicolascole77 about how I built a system for writing content.
  The 500+ people on the call seemed to be amazed by it.
  That led to my 2nd course, The Content Operating System. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619435441287168))
- 18/ Added MRR
  I noticed that each week I was spending time creating content templates for myself.
  What if my audience wanted those too?
  I tested it as a $9 upsell on each course.
  8 months later it has 2,100+ subscribers.
  Almost $19.3k MRR from something I was already doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619437718872065))
- 19/ Started a newsletter
  In January of 2022, I launched my newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.
  I was determined to deliver one piece of actionable advice each Saturday AM that could be read in 4 minutes or less.
  In the last 17 months, I've grown it to 115k+ subs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619439761489925))
- 20/ Added sponsorships
  With over 115k subs, I can charge for each issue to be sponsored.
  I have 2 slots per issue, per week, that sell for $2,500.
  Now each weekly newsletter is paying $5,000, and people are getting their brand and business in front of a ton of readers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619441774940161))
- Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like:
  Products: $2.34M
  Consulting: $1.17M
  MRR: $197k
  Sponsorships: $164k
  Community: $130k ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619444152942593))
- A few notes of potential interest:
  1. I no longer do anything SaaS-related.
  2. I don't do any paid ads.
  3. I don't have any full-time employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized and a part-time VA.
  4. I don't have any "growth assistants" or writers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619446438842369))
- One last note:
  While this thread might be easy to read, none of this was actually easy.
  - It's taken ~4 years & 4,000 pieces of content
  - There are days when I think it's all going away
  - I'm an outlier - the creator game is tough
  Does that mean you shouldn't try? No.
  But... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1660619448795951105))
- You should have a very "long game" mentality.
  1. Start a side project.
  2. Build it to 60% of your salary
  3. Then go all in.
  Good luck! I'm rooting for you.
