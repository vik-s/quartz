## Highlights
- One year ago today, I gave my notice of leaving Airbnb!
  If you’re a creator on the fence of leaving your job, here’s the things I did to muster the courage to do so:
  - I set aside a year of living expenses
  I told myself if I couldn’t live a nice life in SF on my creator money after a year, I would go back to big tech
  - I surrounded myself by other full-time creators like <a href="https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS">@KenJee_DS</a> 
  - I setup an S corp, EcZachly Inc as my entity for making money
  - I gave myself a game plan. I needed to start making money a month after quitting Airbnb
  What’s holding you back from pursuing entrepreneurship full time?
