- Waffle House positions its stores: 
  • Along already-existing traffic streams
  • Offers a complementary service
  • Gobbles up excess traffic
  What traffic do they gobble up?

- Here's what WH knows:
  When people shop at Walmart they:
  • Drive a considerable distance
  • Are traveling with family
  • Will need to eat
  WH gobbles up the already existing traffic in the area and fills a need
  Now let's see how to use this for our audience building... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705220060229378151))
- 1. Find your "Walmarts"
  What niche-related accounts do you already follow?
  • Find 20-30 large accounts
  • Add them to a list/bookmark
  • Find when they post their content
  This will help you "gobble up" traffic https://t.co/86ft70yjNy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705220096426193094))
- 2. Add your complementary value
  Comments like:
  • "Agree"
  • "Amazing"
  • "This is great"
  Do nothing.
  Make sure you add to the conversation:
  • Offer a different approach
  • Expand on an idea presented
  • Answer questions for other commenters
  Add value. https://t.co/Hz8xxUGEox ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705220138633511304))
- 3. Find "Super" Walmarts
  Super Wal-Marts are long-form content:
  • Threads
  • Carousels
  Many of these piece of content are getting 1-5M impressions.
  All you need to do is capture a little bit of that traffic. https://t.co/hAZGAvkDpj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705220187316781436))
- 4. Repurpose your comment into content
  When comments add value – they can become standalone content:
  • Posts
  • Tweets
  • Threads
  • Carousels
  This is the power of using value-added comments. https://t.co/viFjzPhWn5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705224058722238519))
- 5. Review your data
  Ask yourself, "what does this data tell me?"
  Different data tells a different story:
  • Likes → "I approve of this content"
  • Shares → "I need to tell others about this"
  • Comments → "I need more information on this"
  Analyze your data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705224065085030863))
- 6. Keep adding Walmarts
  And repeat the process...
  And keep adding your complementary value:
  • Find a Wal-mart
  • Find "super" Walmarts
  • Add value-driven comments
  • Repurpose those comments into content https://t.co/kZhWxq2lAk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705224106763780440))
- Big takeaways in closing:
  • You want niche-related Walmarts
  • The faster to comment – the better
  • A bigger list gives you more opportunity
  • You can expand comments into long-form
  Other than that – use other creator's traffic and re-direct it for your own growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1705224110001823799))
- The simplest way to 2,000+ followers is by writing "valuable" comments.
