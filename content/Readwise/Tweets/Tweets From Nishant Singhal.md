## Highlights
- Choice between between x and x^2.
  Everybody wants to be x^2 because we all know x^2 is greater than x for all x> 1
  But it is not easy. There is a price to be paid.
  In the initial journey from zero to one, x^2 would lag behind x. Peers and family would make fun of x^2 and compare her journey to x.
  Heck, even x^2 would doubt herself and her unique capabilities (existence of double derivative!)
  However she would realise her potential at 0.5 when her slope would suddenly be at par with x.
  The world would start noticing once she crosses the tipping point of 1, when she covers up all the lost ground to x.
  Finally, everybody would be in awe when she accelerates magically, galloping towards infinity at ever increasing velocity leaving behind x, huffing and puffing.
  Slow and steady, eventually wins the race. But the steady needs to be acceleration, not velocity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kandoi_nishant/status/1638469429129355265))
