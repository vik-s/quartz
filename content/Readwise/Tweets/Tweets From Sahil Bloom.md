## Highlights
- Here's a simple to-do list trick anyone can use:
  *(bookmark this and try it later)*
  I've tried every fancy productivity system, but I've found the painfully simple strategy that works for me...
  This 3x5 notecard.
  Each evening, I sit down at my desk and write down the 3-5 highest impact to-dos for the following day.
  These are the "important" tasks that directly contribute to my long-term projects or goals
  *The tasks that fall in the red dashed box of this matrix.*
  The list is pureâ€”I specifically avoid writing down all of the miscellaneous urgent and unimportant to-dos (more on that later).
  In the morning, I sit down at my desk for my first focus work block and start at the top of the list, working my way down and crossing off the important items as I get through them.
  My primary goal is to cross each item off the list by the end of the day.
  I am intentionally conservative in the number of items I write on the list. It's usually 3, sometimes 4, and very rarely 5.
  I never want to end the day with open items, so being conservative helps me accomplish that (and get the extra rush from getting through more than I expected).
  As I go through the day, I stole an idea from Marc Andreessen to use the back of the card to write down and cross off any minor to-dos that I complete (the urgent or unimportant tasks that are not welcome on the front of the card).
  The process of writing and crossing off an item on the back of the card is a further boost of momentum, so I find it to be a worthwhile exercise.
  My notecard productivity system is painfully simple, but it's grounded in five powerful realizations:
  1. 15 minutes of prep in the evening is worth hours the next morning.
  By setting out your priority tasks the night before, you eliminate any friction from having to decide what to work on. You hit the ground sprinting.
  2. Important > Urgent.
  By tackling the important to start the day, you guarantee progress against the big picture projects and goals.
  If my day went to hell after that morning focus block (which it sometimes does with a 1-year-old at home!), it would be ok, because I know I've gotten through much of my important work.
  3. Momentum is everything.
  Crossing important items off your list to start the day immediately creates a winning feeling that you keep with you. Success begets success.
  4. Simple is beautiful.
  If you're spending time thinking about your productivity system, you're studying for the wrong test.
  That's movement for the sake of movement. You should be focused on progress.
  5. Find what works for you.
  It used to stress me out that I didn't have a beautiful productivity system that would impress others. Then I realized that whatever works for me is the best productivity system.
  Identify how you operate and find the system that works for you.
  To get started, just buy a stack of simple 3x5 notecards and give it a shot.
  If you've ever been overwhelmed by productivity systems and advice, this is an approach to try.
