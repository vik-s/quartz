## Highlights
- Here's a simple to-do list trick anyone can use:
  *(bookmark this and try it later)*
  I've tried every fancy productivity system, but I've found the painfully simple strategy that works for me...
  This 3x5 notecard.
  Each evening, I sit down at my desk and write down the 3-5 highest impact to-dos for the following day.
  These are the "important" tasks that directly contribute to my long-term projects or goals
  *The tasks that fall in the red dashed box of this matrix.*
  The list is pure—I specifically avoid writing down all of the miscellaneous urgent and unimportant to-dos (more on that later).
  In the morning, I sit down at my desk for my first focus work block and start at the top of the list, working my way down and crossing off the important items as I get through them.
  My primary goal is to cross each item off the list by the end of the day.
  I am intentionally conservative in the number of items I write on the list. It's usually 3, sometimes 4, and very rarely 5.
  I never want to end the day with open items, so being conservative helps me accomplish that (and get the extra rush from getting through more than I expected).
  As I go through the day, I stole an idea from Marc Andreessen to use the back of the card to write down and cross off any minor to-dos that I complete (the urgent or unimportant tasks that are not welcome on the front of the card).
  The process of writing and crossing off an item on the back of the card is a further boost of momentum, so I find it to be a worthwhile exercise.
  My notecard productivity system is painfully simple, but it's grounded in five powerful realizations:
  1. 15 minutes of prep in the evening is worth hours the next morning.
  By setting out your priority tasks the night before, you eliminate any friction from having to decide what to work on. You hit the ground sprinting.
  2. Important > Urgent.
  By tackling the important to start the day, you guarantee progress against the big picture projects and goals.
  If my day went to hell after that morning focus block (which it sometimes does with a 1-year-old at home!), it would be ok, because I know I've gotten through much of my important work.
  3. Momentum is everything.
  Crossing important items off your list to start the day immediately creates a winning feeling that you keep with you. Success begets success.
  4. Simple is beautiful.
  If you're spending time thinking about your productivity system, you're studying for the wrong test.
  That's movement for the sake of movement. You should be focused on progress.
  5. Find what works for you.
  It used to stress me out that I didn't have a beautiful productivity system that would impress others. Then I realized that whatever works for me is the best productivity system.
  Identify how you operate and find the system that works for you.
  To get started, just buy a stack of simple 3x5 notecards and give it a shot.
  If you've ever been overwhelmed by productivity systems and advice, this is an approach to try.

- Hot Take: Being busy is holding you back from achieving your goals.
  The Busy Trap (and how to escape it):
  It feels like everyone is so damn busy.
  If you're at a party, you're going to hear the word "busy" at least 100 times.
  Why do we SAY we're busy?
  • To flex or signal of our value to others
  • To avoid workplace scrutiny
  Why do we FEEL so busy?
  • Constant 24/7 connectedness
  • Obsessive optimization of schedules
  • Failures of prioritization
  There are negative consequences from falling into the Busy Trap:
  • Urgent > Important: Busyness saps our creative energy and forces an inefficient allocation of our precious mental resources. You spend time on urgent things that don't matter and miss the important things that do.
  • Physical Health: Busyness gives you an excuse to cut corners. How many times have you used your busyness to justify missing a workout, eating an unhealthy takeout meal, or staying up too late? It's natural, but it's harmful in the long run.
  • Mental Health: Busyness is a recipe for burnout. If you feel overwhelmingly busy for long enough, you eventually break.
  • Gratitude: When you're always busy, you never stop to smell the sweetness in the air.
  Here are 3 simple strategies to escape the Busy Trap:
  **1. Reframe the Goal**
  The first step is to eliminate our desire to say we are busy. We need to remove "busy" as a positive signal from our collective consciousness.
  The goal isn't to generate prolific input—the goal is to generate prolific output per unit input. With high output per unit input, you can decide on your level of input based on your personal situation and desires.
  Let's make anti-busyness the new flex!
  **2. Focus on the Important**
  Be deliberate about identifying what is important in your life and work.
  Make a list of your top-25 priorities. Circle the top 3-5 items. Those are your important items. Everything you didn't circle should be avoided at all costs.
  **3. Embrace Boredom**
  "All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone." - Blaise Pascal
  To spark the change, try my Creative Boredom Challenge:
  • 5 days, 30 min per day
  • No technology allowed
  • No books or reading
  • No social interaction
  • Dynamic (walking) or static
  Let your mind simply wander. Carry a small notebook to log any interesting ideas or insights.
  Start scheduling more free time into your days. Creating this free time will unlock you to think about the big picture. When you have free time, you have the headspace and bandwidth to pursue new ideas. Free time increases your luck surface area.
  ***
  Follow these three strategies to escape the Busy Trap and create new growth in your life:
  1. Reframe anti-busy as the flex.
  2. Focus on the important.
  3. Embrace boredom.
