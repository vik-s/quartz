## Highlights
- my best advice for getting into tech 2024
  tech is open to anyone with enough grit. it's hard, it's really really hard. harder than a lot of people will tell you. it continues to be hard and i suspect it's getting harder
  * some bugs take an enormous amount of investigation
  * sometimes you work with someone that drives you nuts 
  * tech can be numbingly boring
  learn to love the process. i never had the privilege of "doing something i loved because..." (broke/threatened with murder) but i learned to love the pain and i learned to love the process
  to this day i am regularly rediscovering it, regularly stoking desire and passion for tech. i have no idea how anyone makes it for 30 years without a desire, hope, and passion, but most of all, a touch of love
  even the most boring tasks can be the greatest teachers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1741988721283461459))
