## Highlights
- The average X user makes 2 huge mistakes:
  #1: They only consume from the ‚ÄòFor You‚Äô feed
  #2: They follow people from hundreds of different niches
  Lots of dopamine, not much retention.
  There‚Äôs a better way to use X. Here‚Äôs how: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1719368746467315749))
    - Note: Save
- Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you could log in to X and use it with intention?
  ‚Ä¢ No ads, no suggested tweets, no doomscrolling
  ‚Ä¢ Viewing tweets by topic instead of all in one feed
  ‚Ä¢ See only high-quality tweets from people you follow
  We just need 3 easy steps to get us there üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1719368750867046556))
- Step 1: Create a List
  ‚Ä¢ Choose your topic
  ‚Äã‚Ä¢ Name the List
  ‚Ä¢ Make it private
  ‚Ä¢ Add people
  ‚Ä¢ Repeat
  The goal here is to intentionally fill your Lists with people you want to learn from.
  The only problem here is X displays them a little weird.
  So let's fix that ‚¨áÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1719368753157214714))
- Step 2: Login To X Pro
  X Pro helps you create a powerful dashboard to help you spend time with more intention.
  It's easy to get started:
  ‚Ä¢ Go to https://t.co/EhyBL2R4dj
  ‚Ä¢ Sign-in (You'll need Premium)
  Once you're logged in, it's time to set up your dashboard üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1719368755703075245))
- Step 3: Create A Custom Column
  Here's how:
  ‚Ä¢ Copy the "number" at the end of your List URL
  ‚Ä¢ Add a column on X Pro and click ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù
  ‚Ä¢ Create a query which ignores replies and only shows posts with over 50 likes:
  "list:yourlistnumber -filter:replies min_faves:50"
  Boom. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1719368758647472286))
- Creating Lists and filters like this have 3 major benefits:
  #1: Improve signal-to-noise ratio of tweets you see.
  #2: Foster specific relationships with intention.
  #3: Spend 1/10th the amount of time on X (with 10x the impact).
  Step your game up.
