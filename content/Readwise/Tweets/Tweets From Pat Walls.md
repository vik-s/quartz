## Highlights
- For anyone building a side project with the goal of quitting your FT job:
  1. Your job is a 40hr week commitment, and thatâ€™s it
  2. Accept your performance review being "meets expectations"
  3. Don't take work home w/ you.
  Preserve your precious brainpower for nights & weekends. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls/status/1702022932715696357))
