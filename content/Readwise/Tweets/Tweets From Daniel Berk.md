## Highlights
- How to become a millionaire:

  7. Make more money from Boosts because you are growing faster from spending money you’re making from Twitter to grow from Boosts
  8. Include Boosts in your newsletter to your now larger audience and get paid whenever someone clicks your in-line Boosts recommendations
  9. Run ads that make you more money from beehiiv’s ad network because now your audience is growing because your Boosts are working
  10. Create a lead magnet and post about it on Twitter— require they subscribe to your newsletter in order to receive the lead magnet (this is an easy automation on beehiiv)
  11. Get a ton of subscribers from this lead magnet, all of which will see your Boosts and have a chance to subscribe to your recommendations which will make you more money
  12. Get paid from Twitter for this series of tweets that all get a lot of traction because you are now an influencer 
  13. Put the money you made from Twitter into Boosts to accelerate your newsletter growth
