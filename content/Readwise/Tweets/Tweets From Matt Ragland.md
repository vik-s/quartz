## Highlights
- ***How the f*ck do you write so many books so fast?! ***
  That’s what George RR Martin said to Stephen King at a fireside chat in 2018.
  King, who some people joke gets “paid by the inch” on his books, contrasted with GRRM, who is still writing the next *Game of Thrones* book 12 years later (King has published 15 full-length novels since then).
  So when GRRM asks King *“how do you write books so fast?”* King describes his writing goal of 6 pages a day, 60 days in a row, to get a 360 page manuscript done.
  **GRRM, bewildered, asks...**
  *“Aren’t there days you get distracted, check your email, wonder if you had any talent at all, and thought you shoulda been a plumber?”*
  **King’s answer is great:**
  *“This is real life, there are things you have to do. But mostly I make the time to get 6 pages in, although entropy tries to intervene”*
  No hacks, no shortcuts, just 6 pages a day for 60 days.
  **Two Lessons to Highlight **💡
  1** - King’s writing goal is an example of a Task System. **He wants to write 6 pages a day, no matter how long that takes. 
  By now he knows it takes 3-4 hours though. The other type of goal is a Time System - write for 1 hour, no matter how words you get.
  Too many people try to do both at once, and it doesn’t work well. You can’t write 1000 words and make it an hour every day. 
  If you have a word/page goal, that has to be the top priority. Most writers—unless you’re a “big W” Writer—should have a time goal of writing for 30-60 minutes no matter how many words come out.
  2** - George RR Martin has made more money and had more success that 99.9% of writers. **But he still has doubts and asks these questions! 
  “*Should I have been a plumber?” *is a wild statement and something that I would never think a person like him would make. It reminds me of the chapter in B*ird by Bird *where Anne Lamott has this to say about “shitty first drafts.”
  "*I know some very great writers, writers you love who write beautifully and have made a great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely feeling wildly enthusiastic and confident. Not one of them writes elegant first drafts. All right, one of them does, but we do not like her very much."
  *
  Next time you sit down to write your newsletter or book — d**ecide if your goal is task or time oriented. **That will help you better measure success.
  And when you inevitably hit the moment of doubt, where you wonder if you should have been a high school football coach or gone into finance — r**emember that in some universe, George RR Martin is a plumber with an idea for fantasy series that he never got around to writing.
