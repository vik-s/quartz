## Highlights
- **My writing skyrocketed after learning 1 simple skill:**
  Formatting.
  Here are my 7 best tips for beginner writers:
  *(you want to bookmark this)*
  **1/ Start with 1 single sentence**
  Your reader is busy.
  Thatâ€™s why you donâ€™t want to write super-long headlines that stretch over more than 2 lines.
  Make it easy for your reader to fall down the page.
  (Pros call this a "slippery slideâ€œ)
  **2/ List your sub-headlines**
  Most people skim a post before they read the entire text.
  Sub-headlines will help them decide whether itâ€™s worth their time.
  You can also view them as "checkpointsâ€œ.
  **3/ Vary sentence lengths**
  If you write 3 sentences and theyâ€™re all about the same length?
  Itâ€™s boring to read.
  But varying sentence lengths will keep your writing novel, make it flow and add rhythm.
  Right?
  **4/ Use Bold and Italics**
  But donâ€™t overdo it.
  Hereâ€™s how I use them:
  Bold for hooks and headlines.
  Italics for *"things someone saidâ€œ.*
  **5/ Order lists by length**
  You want to please your readerâ€™s eyes.
  So whenever you list something:
  â–¸ Headlines
  â–¸ Lessons
  â–¸ Tips
  Order them accordingly.
  **6/ Leave white space**
  Reading should feel effortless.
  But if you present your reader with a wall of text, reading becomes painful (as an ex-teacher, I can tell from experience).
  Solution?
  Leave white space and let your reader fall down that page.
  **7/ Use bullet points**
  Hereâ€™s why:
  â–¸ Shorter than sentences
  â–¸ Easy to digest
  â–¸ Look sexy
  Your readers will thank you with their attention.
