- Something I want to beat into everyone's brain:
  THE WORLD WANTS YOU TO BE VANILLA WITH YOUR WRITING. AND YOU SHOULD FIGHT AGAINST THAT.
  Aka corporate crap (but they'll mask it by calling it "being professional"). 
  This makes your company's writing lame, unmemorable, and sterile. 
  Which, I think, bleeds into other parts of the company, spoiling the entire damn place. 
  Think about when a brand's writing actually made you smile or feel something. Often, its because they're acting like a real person. You can do the bare minimum and stick out tbh.
  Your corporate emails, product descriptions, blog, whatever. Write as if you're writing to one person who you're friendly with. 
  Like you're a mom+pop operation vs a dull committee trying to please everyone. 
  You're not one person from 9 to 5 then another person from 5 to midnight.
  You can be fun, casual informal AND professional. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thesamparr/status/1745857889615409645))

- Beautiful example of Parkinson's law:
  In 1960's, average dinner plate was 8.5 inches, or ~800 calories of food.
  Today its over 12 inches, 1900 cals of food.
  A trick for losing weight (or getting fat): make your plate smaller.
  Humans fill the amount of space we're given.
