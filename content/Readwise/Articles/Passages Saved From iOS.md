## Highlights
- Unlike what your media circles of success-story-con-artists would have you believe, success is a SLOW, DELIBERATE process. You pick a path and you walk it, taking in the sights and sounds and deciding if it's for you. Then you pick another path and walk down it, and you continue doing so, all the while diligently socking 10-15% of your income away into a sound, diversified investment portfolio (which is your fallback plan). Or just do index funds if you don't want to think about it too much.
  Eventually, you might just find something that grabs you, and then you pursue it, and make something from it. THAT is the measure of success.
  And if you don't, you still have your investment portfolio from which you can live comfortably. Some people don't discover their success path until far later in life.
