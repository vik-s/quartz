- How to Build Your Braintrust
  Your Braintrust is a group of 5-10 individuals.
  A few key features of the members of the group:
  1. Unbiased (ideally not family).
  2. Diverse experiences, perspectives, lenses.
  3. Willing to provide raw feedback and candor.
  4. Vested interest in your success (i.e. they want to see you win).
  As you construct your Braintrust, it may be helpful to think about each member as fitting one particular archetype:
  • Senior executive: navigating hierarchies and senior ranks.
  • Inspirational leader: leadership principles and people management.
  • Intellectual sparring partner: willing to pressure test your thinking.
  • Contrarian thinker: willing to play the devil’s advocate.
  • Connector: deep relationships and network.
  • Peer: similar personal or professional stage to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hckfs6yx2rwwkn4jhc5ekt19))

- Over time, you can add and subtract from your group. Add new and deep relationships, subtract people who have diminishing value as you or they have changed or progressed.
