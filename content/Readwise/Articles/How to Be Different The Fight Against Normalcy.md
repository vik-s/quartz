## Highlights
- A team of researchers were trying to study zebras in the wild when they noticed a unique challenge:
  Every time they'd observe a behavior of a specific zebra and look down to jot it in their notebooks, they'd lose track of the zebra they had observed in the pack. The black and white stripes made it exceedingly difficult to keep tabs on any specific zebra.
  To solve this, the researchers placed a single red dot on the target zebra to make it easier to follow.
  It worked—the target zebra was much easier to track, not just for the human researchers, but also for the lions hunting it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01herrepqn4r7t68s0s36gd316))
- Within days, each target zebra was taken down by the lions.
  As the researchers learned, standing out can be dangerous. Blending in with the pack is often a survival mechanism—the Zebra Effect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01herrf837h34vrm1qfc4res0j))
