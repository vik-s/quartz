## Highlights
- SpaceX’s [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) broadband communications LEO satellites are probably the most famous, but Amazon has begun launching its competing [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/what-is-amazon-project-kuiper) satellites and expects to begin service this year. Other companies are entering the market, not only to provide broadband access but also to build the smaller rockets. They include [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en/space/telecom/constellations), [ArianeGroup](https://www.ariane.group/en/), the [China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp](https://spacenews.com/china-to-begin-constructing-its-own-megaconstellation-later-this-year/)., and [Tata Advanced Systems](https://www.satellitetoday.com/imagery-and-sensing/2023/11/29/tata-advanced-systems-and-satellogic-to-build-leo-satellites-in-india/).

- The LEO satellite market is likely to grow from more than US $4 billion in 2022 to [nearly $7 billion in 2031](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/leo-satellite-market-100025), according to Business Research Insights.

- Although the market is growing, the number of engineers and technologists who understand the complicated systems is not. That’s why in 2021 IEEE launched the Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites and Systems (LEO SatS) project under the leadership of [Witold Kinsner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/witold-kinsner-314304a0/?originalSubdomain=ca) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0mqjqfvvttyfv723zm3mf9))
- The LEO SatS education and contest working group has held several seminars, now available on [IEEE.tv](http://www.ieee.tv/). An [introductory workshop on the satellites](https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/projects/leo-satellites-systems/ieee-leo-sats-fall-ws/) held in 2021 covered [nanosatellites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcY8sSUU8w), [communication security challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGxWr92M4fo), and [data centers and time synchronization](https://youtu.be/ikJM87wp4K0).

- During the [2022 IEEE Education Week](https://ieee-edusociety.org/ieee-education-week-2022), the group hosted a [virtual panel discussion on space education](https://ieee.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/ieee/recording/18ced09898a9103aa95f9a94dbc9df3c/playback). Panelists discussed the spacecraft, applications, and career paths. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0mrka9qr8tanb2pgtv9ea5))
- He says lesson plans also are being developed for [CubeSats](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space), which are designed in a modular fashion based on the 10-by-10-by-10-centimeter base unit referred to as 1U. CubeSats are being used to teach students about the technology by showing them how to build and launch the small rockets themselves. Researchers are testing larger CubeSats, from 3U to 6U, for commercial missions. Universities are studying the sixth generation of the satellites, Kinsner says, with many being placed in the shell of a LEO satellite.
