## Highlights
- Leverage — digital in particular — hasn’t just lowered the barrier to entrepreneurship; it’s torn it down ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6n8vb2pcdkdbx60h3tmdwk))
- You have 5 pillars of leverage:
  1. Profession
  2. Presence
  3. Product
  4. Process
  5. People ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6n9292srcajt0wyfmtphfb))
- Profession ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6n9c4xn19803pgd07nnw1s))
- Without skill, you have no market value. No reason for people to pay attention. No way to set yourself apart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6n9kr992tb3zcr6m8kncr6))
- Presence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6na9accztvcksefdxx79qm))
- Reach is measurable: the claps, the likes, the shares. But reputation is like the engine of your car. You don’t see it, but it’s the driving force behind all results — you must care for it deeply. It takes decades to build and moments to destroy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nb0e3qts3vwakjgs3ytq6))
- Overdeliver. Focus on quality. Treat your audience with respect. Don’t get sucked into algorithm games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nb6ynp5c5qgh5d1s0tn9p))
- Product ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nb8qz732ftcwpe2etw9jd))
- Naval Ravikant once said you’ll never get rich renting out your time. You need a way to solve problems at scale: products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nbgh7gx77fk8k03f68jg2))
- The best products have no or low marginal cost of replication:
  • Books
  • Software
  • Digital courses
  • Physical goods
  • Paid newsletters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nbpa0fy75fy774en5qdrs))
- The building phase is tough, but once done, every email you write has the potential to grow your business (without you selling your time). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nc3d5wvcqkd8tt6r5ay1w))
- Process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nc52vexa1mn3wxh6ayf2e))
- Process is your fulcrum. Without it, everything will be a struggle. But with it, your potential is insane. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6ncaa4ac2b70z6mk65ydgg))
- Set aside several hours a week to look at your process. Eliminate friction with these 4 questions:
  1. Can I get a robot to do it? (automation)
  2. Can I get someone else to do it? (delegation)
  3. Can I get this to run smoother? (systemisation)
  4. Can I stop doing this altogether? (elimination) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6ncrwpsj420antfvdcpf7s))
- People ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nd32nd9g1w73cxacncs7j))
- You have three groups of people to focus on:
  • Those ‘behind’ — your team and audience
  • Those at your level — your peers
  • Those ahead — your mentors ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6ndedmb3cpg8pkhdkre6h2))
- A team will help you strip away non-creative tasks so you can focus on your area of highest potential impact ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6ndzrpdfzawr5v24ccj68y))
- There’s a common theme at the moment that ‘free content doesn’t work’. I disagree. Free content works *if it’s good enough.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6ne8gdh5zz84rkd7bzgv9g))
- You should overdeliver for everyone, not just your customers (listen to your customers too — feedback is gold for your growth). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nebq9d5rjsk9p6zx3jjfz))
- Peers are the people in your network. Having friends to bounce ideas, give feedback, and promote each other can you take you far. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6negdkdfjva49ffpz3hyyk))
- And mentors? They give you speed. You pay for their knowledge but you gain their wisdom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nempkexe573jcs2kz88gj))
- Be generous, selfless, and hardworking. The world will reciprocate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6neryb0pvne30y20bxcmkx))
- Climbing the leverage ladder ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nezgm668jynv719nyk7mp))
- Commit to a craft. Specialise in a skill. Become well known. Build smart systems. Create connections. Layer on as much leverage as possible and keep putting in the reps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nf9nw15x5hd14x8djke1d))
- The view is worth the climb, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6nfgh1s79ye3v3n63abpsh))
