- 4. Now just go down your list of Main Points, section by section. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd6qfkar3t3j86r3z5xytbym))
- All your sub-points are your "notes" of what to write about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd6qfvwp8tdqrfk0wdpwrkre))
- 5. Do a final spelling/grammar read through. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd6qgcc1zpf47p4m5zwqb6x6))
