## Highlights
- Optical connectivity – and especially silicon photonics – is expected to become a crucial technology to enable connectivity for next-generation datacenters, particularly those designed HPC applications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygaxbbaf30pamxd0vm6g8k))
- TSMC, who this week outlined its 3D Optical Engine roadmap as part of its 2024 North American Technology Symposium, laying out its plan to bring up to 12.8 Tbps optical connectivity to TSMC-fabbed processors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygbakcrvpv7x8avr93mn92))
- TSMC's Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) stacks an electronics integrated circuit on photonic integrated circuit (EIC-on-PIC) using the company's SoIC-X packaging technology. The foundry says that usage of its SoIC-X enables the lowest impedance at the die-to-die interface and therefore the highest energy efficiency. The EIC itself is produced at a 65nm-class process technology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygcb77q4y3nertcv4k7n1w))
- TSMC's 1st Generation 3D Optical Engine (or COUPE) will be integrated into an OSFP pluggable device running at 1.6 Tbps. That's a transfer rate well ahead of current copper Ethernet standards – which top out at 800 Gbps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygdd66s3x122syfrn1k18c))
- the 2nd Generation of COUPE is designed to integrate into CoWoS packaging as co-packaged optics with a switch, allowing optical interconnections to be brought to the motherboard level. This version COUPE will support data transfer rates of up to 6.40 Tbps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygfq54navd3z980r5pw4qe))
- TSMC's third iteration of COUPE – COUPE running on a CoWoS interposer – is projected to improve on things one step further, increasing transfer rates to 12.8 Tbps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygjqvdr5gge96qt4qk5xjg))
- TSMC has not participated in the silicon photonics market up until now, leaving this to players like GlobalFoundries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwygm22ehq15q9xwwg5d4mny))
