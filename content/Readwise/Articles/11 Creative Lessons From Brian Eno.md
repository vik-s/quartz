## Highlights
- Eno says that [“art is everything you *don’t* *have* to do”](https://link.workweek.com/click/33415333.54664/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1YSVZmd0RKLWtEayZ0PTg1N3MmaGFzaGVkX3VzZXI9NGRiMDUzMGRjMmI2MzdkZGZhZGY4ZTlkYTViZGU2YTU/653c811216aa445dc5f8b6fcBa7bbceb2) .

- Each object has a necessary function, while everything else is considered "art." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhfh913at3xrs8sv8jphkga))
- This might be Eno’s most popular idea.
  Scenius is a great portmanteau of “scene” and “genius” and it stands for “the intelligence and intuition of a whole cultural scene…it is the communal form of the concept of the genius… scenius is like genius, only embedded in a scene rather than in a gene”.
  Instead of lionizing individual geniuses, it is important to consider the “scene” they operated in and how that environment influenced and inspired their work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhfk5v19tbnnxpxnb0a9yss))
- Eno also cautions against introducing polish too early in the process.
  He calls it “premature sheen”. You can basically take any raw music and make it “sound good” right away. But if you do that too early, you’re [short-circuiting the exploration process of what you are actually trying to create](https://link.workweek.com/click/33415333.54664/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9VaTlUUExUVi1Saz9zaT1RR3J6RWhsUDFEQ19hZkRuJnQ9MzYwJmhhc2hlZF91c2VyPTRkYjA1MzBkYzJiNjM3ZGRmYWRmOGU5ZGE1YmRlNmE1/653c811216aa445dc5f8b6fcCc58a31da) : ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhfmmeyej5nvbw8d2t4hk9c))
- **The anchor of success**
  Never be satisfied with your previous work.
  Don’t get pigeon-holed on previous successes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhfmx37gqgb8ve0pvc44j41))
