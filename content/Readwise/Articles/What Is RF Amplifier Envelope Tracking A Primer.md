## Highlights
- Envelope tracking beginnings
  Envelope tracking technology was first developed in the 1930s to address the energy problems associated with high power amplitude modulated broadcast transmitters. Loy E Barton described a system for high level modulation in the May 1930 edition of the University of Arkansas Bulletin. The article was the result of several years of work by this little know genius who also invented the class B amplifier.
  The idea fell into disuse and was not widely used until the late 1990s when cellular base station manufacturers started to investigate its use with 3G technology. The modulation format used with 3G meant that the RF amplifier efficiency was less than that that could be obtained for 2G systems which predominantly used a form of modulation with no amplitude content. However it took until about 2008 before the first base stations using envelope tracking were launched
  The system presented many issues as high modulation bandwidths were required. It was also considered for use within the phones themselves and the first of these phones was launched by Samsung in September 2014, and it is now employed in many smartphones.

- Envelope tracking provides some significant advantages in terms of minimising the power used in RF amplifiers and this can have a significant impact on battery life if this form of power is used. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he36wzjaswqftnw5gn051e00))

- The efficiency of an amplifier depends upon the shape of the waveform and the mode in which it is operating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he373tvm4zqv1nnq6pny6y6t))
- To achieve better efficiency levels, it is possible to drive the amplifier into compression. Much greater levels of efficiency can be achieved, and if a steady waveform, like FM is used, the only degradation of the signal is that additional harmonics of the fundamental carrier are generated and these can be filtered out using RF filters.

- Unfortunately when modulation with an amplitude component is applied to a carrier this is distorted if it is passed through an amplifier that is run in compression. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he375da4xym9zag345a5cnkb))
- The situation becomes worse as if the peak to average ratio is high, i.e. the waveform has higher peak levels when compared to the average because the amplifier has to be able to accommodate the peaks while still only running at a low average power level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he377bqm5b7efz3sx0vftws2))
- During the peaks, the amplifier requires the full voltage to be able to deliver the required power without running into compression, but during the periods of lower signal, this voltage is not required and means that power is dissipated in the device. The amplifier only requires a smaller voltage to deliver the lower levels of power and therefore running with the higher voltage all the time, unnecessarily wastes power.

- As the name indicates, envelope tracking employs a system whereby the amplitude envelope of the signal is tracked and utilised by the amplifier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he379k1qwe5d6q0jnaf63qzz))
- Using envelope tracking the power supply voltage applied to the power amplifier is constantly adjusted to ensure that the amplifier is operating at peak efficiency for the given instantaneous output power requirements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he379rkjyy00mshg48h1p11r))
- An envelope tracking systems will take the envelope appearing at the input of the power amplifier and then use this to drive the power supply providing the line voltage for the RF power amplifier. This is modulated to ensure that it correctly tracks the amplitude of the signal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he37adgxh5kj90epn4n2chkk))
