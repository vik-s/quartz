## Highlights
- Wi-Fi 7 introduces the concept of priority channels and the ability to schedule traffic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg3yw6ax9v1qca9ye00mxa1))
- The Wi-Fi Alliance is expected to certify the Wi-Fi 7 (or 802.11be) standard sometime around the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg3zd1v7gkdh1q64xej83e7))

- in order for a device to be use in a multi-user fashion, it has to be a Wi-Fi 6 device, meaning Wi-Fi 5 or earlier devices will always be single user. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg43hty8tav671rhkh811hg))
- Several standards for Wi-Fi 7, however, will directly address the multi-user challenges of Wi-Fi 6. While Wi-Fi 7 boasts a number of notable features like support of both 320 MHz transmissions — double the 160 MHz of Wi-Fi 6 — and 4096-QAM, which delivers significant speed increases, one of its most exciting features, and the one that most delivers reliability, might be [Multi-Link Operation](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20220311/network-infrastructure/wi-fi/what-is-high-band-multi-link-for-wi-fi-7) (MLO). With MLO, a device connected in the 5 GHz band that is suffering from degraded performance due to another device popping up on the network will automatically — and very quickly — switch over to the 6 GHz band. In this way, Wi-Fi 7 will actually enable the promised multi-user capabilities first outlined in Wi-Fi 6 standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg44bya0xvwpbdp6z7by65n))
- MLO also better positions Wi-Fi 7 as an IoT technology — for both enterprise and residential environments — because it is more than a speed feature; it delivers redundancy and low-latency capabilities by enabling the concept of priority channels and the ability to schedule traffic.

- He further noted that while 320 megahertz is an impressively wide swath of spectrum, most applications won’t need such a wide channel. Instead, users want guaranteed low latency, meaning that more than anything, they want to prevent interference. “You’ve now got 6 GHz, where you have effectively multiple 20-megahertz channels that you can choose from, so choose one where there is nobody else operating,” he said. “It’s sort of a reverse way to look at it because everyone talks about 320 megahertz, but for many applications probably a clean 20-megahertz channel is a blessing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg47mp701kd5ehgyychwn43))
- The combination of 320-megahertz channels and MLO, he continued, enables the ability to schedule traffic, making it suitable for homes with several connected devices running at once. And it’s this that matters, not ensuring that a single application has a full 320-megahertz channel in which to operate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg49dr2qba1j9ttfgr5wabh))
- Because of this, service providers are moving away from an emphasis on speed in their marketing campaigns. According to Kevin Narimatsu, Broadcom’s associate director of product marketing, carriers no longer boast about gigabit Wi-Fi speeds and faster WAN speeds, and instead focus on messaging around full Wi-Fi coverage with the promise of delivering “a gigabit in every corner of your house.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg49zg1gkqy3d0smpd42x0p))
