- Summary: Jon Haidt praises Mariana Brussoni's work on outdoor risky play, emphasizing the importance of risk and fear in children's play for their development. He highlights the decline in children's outdoor play over the years, attributing it to intensive parenting and a focus on safety over freedom. Brussoni advocates for providing children with time, space, and freedom to engage in risky play, stressing the benefits it offers in physical, cognitive, and emotional development. She encourages parents and educators to prioritize outdoor play to help children thrive.

## Highlights
- We parents are caught in a paradox. We desperately want to keep our children safe and ensure their success. We are also often terrified that they will get hurt and that they will fail—so we do everything we can to prevent that from happening. Yet many of those very efforts to manage our fears have paradoxically reduced our children’s safety and their odds of success.

- I have learned that when we prioritize children’s play (especially the kind of play that involves some risk and lack of supervision) and the freedom to play how they choose, we help create environments where children and youth thrive.[1](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-children-need-risk-fear-and-excitement#footnote-1-142031950) When we don’t, the consequences can be dire.

- Adults in many Western nations, particularly those born before the 1990s, [recall playing with friends](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/330/article/896673/summary) in their neighborhoods, local parks, and abandoned places, making up the rules as they went along, without adult supervision. They often recall a sense of joy, fun, and freedom as they would run, jump, and move their bodies in ways that weren’t allowed indoors. They felt independent, taking risks and figuring things out for themselves. And this is the kind of childhood that has [been common](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-01219-022) for nearly all of human history. Children, like all young mammals, play.

- Today, this kind of childhood is rare ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1efk04tn52fkx4e1sqn7g))

- Time use data show that children’s leisure time has gone down, particularly time spent in unstructured outdoor play, while time spent in academic and screen-based activities has increased ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1esechb364469xmv07eb6))

- Children are wired for [risky play](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14729670802702762), *in which they take physical risks, seek excitement, and satisfy curiosity*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1fv9fmkb7888krd9p68g9))

- Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major [evolutionary advantage](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212) over those who did not. Physically, risky play allows children to explore more diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. [Cognitively](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2022.2152531), it helps them overcome their fears, build their critical thinking skills, and become accustomed to coping independently with difficult situations.

- Risky play can even help children [overcome anxiety disorders](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10567-020-00338-w) and the cognitive distortions that go along with them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1ja3ba4kxqy62vbh3kcgg))

- Through risky play, children practice dealing with strong ambiguous emotions (thrill and excitement could also be interpreted as fear and terror) and situations that abound with uncertainty. It can also show them that they are resilient and capable of coping when things go wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1kp5se469d1heg002bj3b))
- Parents, particularly mothers, have been encouraged to micro-manage their children’s lives, curate their experiences, remove any barriers, and enroll them in diverse structured activities with the intention of enhancing their development and giving them an edge in the race to succeed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1nmw17p28f87xvfyznqxv))
- [Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-014-0035-0) shows that enrollment in structured activities is not associated with improved developmental outcomes, and the [loss of free time](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00593/full?_ga=1.242929867.851339493.1400829831) can be detrimental to developing basic [executive function](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/guide/a-guide-to-executive-function/) skills ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1pfevw0kwpqnnr5xgp29j))
- Parents today receive constant messaging that in order to be “good parents”, they must always keep their children safe ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1q8ebqs4zmge907tr7pv0))
- And it is widely believed that the world is [no longer a safe place](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/) for children to play in. Yet statistics show that it has never been a safer time to be a child. Injury-related deaths are at an all-time low in most Western nations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1qr2zecvbw89sm1y8cv5x))
- **What kids** ***are*** **dying from today are mainly car crashes and suicides, not playing outside unsupervised with friends.** ***Parents are worrying about the wrong causes of injuries and harm*****. In fact, the very strategies that parents use to try to keep their children safe – driving them around, maximizing supervision, and minimizing freedom – are unintentionally increasing the likelihood of injuries and even death.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1rn43xce5zkj09zxk7qrg))
- The problem lies not with our intentions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1t5rq8dcvb7xc75vfbmjw))
- The problem is in the decisions we’ve made to support this noble goal. We’ve prioritized safety over freedom, achievement over play, and screen time over outdoor time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1tc14g1ap0xtnrxycna7j))

- The three key ingredients necessary for thriving play environments are ***Time, Space, and Freedom.*** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1twcxbgn483hesta36fjn))
	- ***Time:*** 
		- Make daily outdoor playtime a priority. That can mean adding it to the schedule ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1v8tdnezt4esem5ased67))
	- ***Space:*** 
		- Children need easy access to stimulating spaces for play; flexible spaces where they can use their imagination and explore risks, rather than spaces dominated by boring play structures and strict rules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1w3ra02gds75cb9j74wmj))
		- For example, “loose parts” (e.g., sticks, lumber, rocks, boxes, and tarps) can turn boring and barren play spaces into places of joy and wonder.While these may look like junk to adults, children love them. Scotland developed [a loose parts toolkit](https://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Loose-Parts-Play-Toolkit-2019-web.pdf) for anyone who wants to get started ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1xvnyznr54k7jxzxyqbqz))
	- ***Freedom:*** 
		- Children need freedom to be able to play the way they choose. The biggest barrier to children’s freedom is us—the adults in their lives—and our need to manage our own fears ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1ymtaky5pf4tx88m0x917))

- Peter Gray suggests that building tighter relationships with neighbors can help parents feel more confident about letting their kids out to play ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1z0rv0mk0nkjs28s241yq))
- For parents working to manage their fears and change their approach to play, our lab developed the [OutsidePlay.org](https://outsideplay.org/) parent tool to help them work through their challenges, figure out what works best for them and develop a plan for change. We’ve tested it rigorously and [it works](https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24861/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqw1zqjpvw5v8dp06ej9j8n7))
