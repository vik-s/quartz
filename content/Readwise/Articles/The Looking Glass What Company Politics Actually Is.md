- The magic incantation in times of conflict
  If you ever find yourself:
  1. Taking 20+ minutes to compose a 2-sentence Slack response
  2. Taking 1+ hour to respond to an e-mail
  3. Raising your voice in a meeting
  It’s time to use the the magic incantation:
  *Let’s continue this tomorrow* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgf2wgk0xzkf74zaz9nbe5))
- *I put together a framework* to break down the process of resolving a disagreement into these five steps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgh6x1xmm6n28sxa8xnrk3))
- 1. Know your position ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgha0fnn23vs559p1g5ncp))
- Before doing anything else, see if you can complete this sentence: “I [don’t agree with/don’t think we should do/don’t like] X because…”
  Your answer doesn’t have to be right. But you first need to *have* an answer and feel good about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhghjkbqy7e956bxkwfwxcn))
- Get a gut check ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhghnv2jhds7wyz2z70351w))
- Before putting stating your disagreement loudly, see if your position resonates with a few trusted confidants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgj1bjafjp2zmgdkvh8bhe))
- If you hear that your position does indeed resonate, you’ll go in feeling more confident in stating your position, with folks who can back you up if need be. These perspectives might also make you see something new or differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgj8365nqr8q6kkmj9mn8k))
- 3. Frame all the options ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgjf1chvpcp66cpsphb2nj))
- Once you know your position and have run it through the gut check, you might be tempted to straight up declare your position in a meeting or via e-mail. Resist this.
  In fact, the most effective way to have a conversation about a decision is to lay out *all* of the options or perspective on the table. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgk0bjevekpdbvgderq1qp))
- The reason you want to frame up *all* the options is threefold. First, it makes it easy for everyone (including the decision maker) to know what they are deciding between. Second, it forces you to understand and empathize with the other side(s) because you can’t describe all the options objectively and convincingly if you don’t. Third, you come across as more objective and trustworthy if you do this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgk7q944x9j4wqnb2dn52x))
- 4. Dig for the root assumptions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgkd7xy9ytr4d1rfx8vzpx))
- The more specific you can be about where exactly your assumptions differ, the easier it is to figure out what to do. Sometimes once you isolate the disagreement, it becomes obvious how you can find the truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgncc43k8ah1q68cpsycep))
- 5. Escalate for a decision ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfhgpjdj34rwz03kt1pgs5m5))
