- Document Note: How does the concept of the "Audience Trust Battery" relate to building a successful creator business?

## Highlights
- The fastest way to build a creator business is to remove financial pressure from it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg07a1wvjx2q6nj4wsahnh9))
- Tobi Lütke (the founder of Shopify) has this fantastic metaphor of a **Trust Battery** . He applies it to members of a team, but it applies to your audience as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg07kwprvr4tkg9wgz8ec0a))
- Now, imagine that every individual in your audience has an internal "trust battery" that either fills or depletes based on their interactions with you. When you fulfill a promise, the battery fills. When you give to your audience without expectation, the battery fills.
  When you break their trust, have a negative interaction, or get pushy when asking for a sale, you drain that battery.
  The more someone's trust battery is charged, the more likely they will act quickly without much need of convincing. This is why some people will buy from you *just because they know and trust you* . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg08vgn20me7gmkvqgytqmb))
- **When you put financial pressure on your business, you're more likely to make bad decisions:**
  • You accept bad sponsors
  • You affiliate for a product you don't believe in
  • You do cross-promos with brands you don't actually like
  • You sell sub-par experiences to your audience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg09110xwrvs2v6zreep4mh))
- Most batteries you purchase come fully charged – but not trust batteries. Actually, it's more likely that your audience comes to you with their trust battery closer to empty (sorry, but the rest of the world has an impact on the trust battery between you and your audience too ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg0984twep2kd3z0wbkmxrz))
- I believe the best time to go "all in" is when you've created a full Audience Trust Battery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg09g2kfrcft5rvvx19vmv0))
- So I encourage people to stick with their jobs as long as they can stand it. A job provides a steady income (which relieves financial pressure). A job typically has stronger boundaries than working for yourself (work ends at ~5pm). Taken together, this helps you make long-term decisions. It also provides **more time** to put towards charging your Audience Trust Battery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg09tr6hcqkk3gx493cw6cj))
- It's far better to have a small audience with a full battery than a large audience on empty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heg0a3hd4xh6t5vbase81h04))
