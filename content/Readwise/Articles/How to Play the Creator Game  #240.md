## Highlights
- The biggest challenge of making it as a creator is the existence of other people also trying to make it as a creator ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn94e9c0smqbp5jmkz1zgg6))
- The problem with this openness to the world is that you become so flooded with information that you don’t know what to do with it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn96f6e13gc60x861fzcan2))
- You also leave yourself susceptible to influence from people skilled in the arts of persuasion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn96xxjjsge94r41teka23y))
- Pair this with the visibility of metrics of success like followers and income data and it can be very easy to adopt someone else’s approach to something because you have mistaken some extrinsic measure of success for wisdom.

- My Solution: Discount Everything Other People Say Or Recommend ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn99k7znnq31jn2dymzbar7))
- But when we see other people expressing these skills, often the result of many years of dedicated work, it appears easy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn9gkpw090a7ajkfgcns0gf))
- The temptation is to follow the current formulas of what already successful people are doing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn9fr4hr7qmamj0q99v76ge))
- Some other traps I’ve seen people be susceptible to:
  1. Giving too much credit to ideas from people they like or envy
  2. Discounting ideas from people you don’t like
  3. Not understanding the unfair advantages that people have because of elite skills, work ethic, financial resources, or connections ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn9je82pj775x69hgq3g4w2))
- Not understanding how much enjoyment other people get out of certain tasks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn9jgnv71mvg1tw6xsnjs5f))
- The creator game is the ultimate act of humility, constantly realizing that you don’t know what you are doing while at the same time paying attention to what other people are doing and then trying stuff out to see if it works for you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcn9k29n6gac8pc26qwefc7z))
