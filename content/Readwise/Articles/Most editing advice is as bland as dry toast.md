## Highlights
- There are three editing types.
  1. Developmental editing 
  2. Copy editing 
  3. Proofreading
  I do them in that order. You want to start with the big picture, then zoom in.
  1. Developmental editing = Structural editing
  Use it to evaluate:
  -Does it answer 'the why' behind your readers' intent? 
  -Is your perspective accurately reflected? 
  -Are arguments supported & complete? 
  -Is your narrative ordered correctly? 
  -Does it meet awareness levels? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh1268bz7br2qbg16z9c1340))
- 2. Copy editing = Flow, format, & function
  Use it to check:
  -Do paragraphs flow seamlessly? 
  -Are sentences written in active voice? 
  -Is it free of redundant words/phrases/ideas? 
  -Does it include “the why” behind “the what”? 
  -Does it have takeaways? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh126mycq42ekcjtv3agxqb5))
- 3. Proofreading = Nitpicking
  -Does it have spelling mistakes/awkward spacing/dialect errors? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh126raj3ygm97xr0zr9ea11))
