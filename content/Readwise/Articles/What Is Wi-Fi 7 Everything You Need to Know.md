## Highlights
- What Benefits Will Wi-Fi 7 Bring? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg50w4h11ypp9g68ttyv4zs))
- Wi-Fi 7 will be faster, support more connections, and be more adaptive to maintain reliable low latency performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg50wef0dkhbmdbhsh7snhy))
- These benefits will help deliver high-quality video and better cloud gaming, and they will serve AR and VR applications that require high throughput and low latency. Wi-Fi 7 also tackles congestion and interference, bringing tangible benefits to areas with densely packed devices or neighboring networks that overlap. The latter is most significant for the enterprise and larger venues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg512afdb3mfr8k0ydvban5))
- Wider Channels ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg51dxr90zpg2ks9c6nkez3))
- Each band is broken into channels. The 2.4-GHz band comprises 11 channels of 20 megahertz (MHz) each. The 5-GHz band has 45 channels, but instead of being limited to a width of 20 MHz, they can combine to create 40-MHz or 80-MHz channels. The 6-GHz band supports 60 channels, and with Wi-Fi 6E they can be as wide as 160 MHz. Wi-Fi 7 supports channels that are up to 320 MHz wide. The wider the channel, the more data it can transmit.

- Higher QAM ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg537hp23p54rht3q4e4mnt))
- Wi-Fi 7 supports 4K-QAM, Wi-Fi 6 supported 1024-QAM, and Wi-Fi 5 was limited to 256-QAM. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg53z9157n4fqmx34yhqsyj))
- The potential benefits are complicated by signal strength, background noise, and interference. Consequently, as QAM goes up, the range drops, and you need a stronger signal. So, the jump to 1024-QAM in Wi-Fi 6 offered around a 25 percent data rate increase over Wi-Fi 5. The leap to 4K-QAM in Wi-Fi 7 translates to a 20 percent increase in peak performance.

- Multi-Link Operation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg550p7bhc6a0r4nmpg1eav))
- Perhaps the most exciting advance in Wi-Fi 7 is Multi-Link Operation (MLO). Every previous Wi-Fi standard establishes a connection between two devices on a single band. Even a tri-band Wi-Fi 6E router connects two devices on a single band on a fixed channel (the router decides whether to connect on the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, or 6-GHz band). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg568cq9na4q21yx5yn71tj))
- MLO can combine several frequencies across bands into a single connection. A Wi-Fi 7 router can connect to a Wi-Fi 7 device across two or more channels in different bands simultaneously. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg56p67erbcg7v2g9cn5tt7))
- Speed isnâ€™t always the priority, but MLO also allows for more efficient performance. A Wi-Fi 7 router can take congestion and other interference into account and transmit on the best channel to bypass it, switching to maintain a stable connection and low latency. MLO may also help mitigate the relatively short range of the 6-GHz band. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgg57j83zdxq0xe0d7439br3))
