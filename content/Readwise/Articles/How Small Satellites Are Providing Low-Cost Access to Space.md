## Highlights
- Miniature satellites are driving a new wave of innovation in space systems and are generating excitement similar to that of the earliest days of space exploration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0mxt487eptagrpp8gn6q1t))
- The tiny satellites are taking on increasingly complex missions. In May the Jet Propulsion Lab–Caltech Mars Cube One mission sent two CubeSats to fly alongside NASA’s InSight lander on its way to Mars ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0myk9w3t0t0sezmafs6fwk))
- Small satellites are allowing commercial enterprises and educational institutions to perform space missions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0myvmzfheefqxp3a9yjcvr))
- Miniature satellites leverage advances in computation, miniaturized electronics, and packaging to produce sophisticated mission capabilities. Because the microsatellites can share the ride to space with other missions, they offer private companies, government space agencies, and universities a more affordable way to make observations about the Earth, conduct research, and test components and systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0mzjz1nx3xetcfkf87zx8a))
- A number of commercial operators are envisioning large constellations of small satellites to open up markets for low-cost data communication, earth observation, and other services. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n031cr98hj7p1gpsfpt6e))
- Small satellites that use commercial off-the-shelf components are cheaper to build, faster to upgrade, and financially less risky if they don’t work as expected. But their capabilities are limited. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n1wd86c3zxdq7ntv0kd8q))
- The history of small satellites is as old as space exploration itself, dating back to the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1. Launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, it weighed 83 kg and had a radio transmitter, batteries, a remote switch, and a fan. The first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, launched in 1958. It weighed 14 kg and carried a cosmic-ray detector, temperature sensors, and a microphone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n4054wcfqnxx9dm2cx4wf))
- The first nongovernment small satellites were built by amateur radio operators who wanted to extend their hobby into space ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n45znc76vrzkvqrf6wpt5))
- The first amateur radio satellite, Oscar 1, was a secondary payload aboard the Thor-DM21 Agena B, launched in 1961 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, near Lompoc, Calif. The 30- by 25- by 12-centimeter box weighed 10 kg and was the world’s first satellite to piggyback on a launch. Despite its size, Oscar 1 included an antenna, batteries, and a transmitter and engaged the imagination of radio amateurs around the world.

- In the mid-1980s, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency started the LightSat initiative to reduce the costs and development time of spacecraft in the 50- to 1,000-kg range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n5mxgwcess1syzkzzmjhw))
- The Global Low Orbit Message Relay microsatellite was the first developed under the program. Its goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of building a two-way, digital data communication satellite capable of performing important military missions in less than a year and for less than $1 million. It weighed 62 kg, was launched in 1985 from the *Challenger* space shuttle, and operated for 14 months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n65rwrzdyebn9arem9ccf))
- A big boost to the small satellite industry occurred in 1999, when California Polytechnic State University and Stanford introduced CubeSats so graduate students could rapidly build nanosatellites with standardized interfaces. CubeSats are made up of one or more modules of 10 cubic cm units, each with a mass of about 1.5 kg. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n6wrwjswebeannxphvkw6))
- The two universities also developed the Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer and the QuadPack 2 multideployer, Sweeting says. The systems demonstrated the interfaces and mechanisms required to support the safe launch of CubeSats as ride-along payloads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n7d8d21n0d6b7j2nqnrtb))
- The first CubeSats were launched in 2003 on a Russian Eurockot. To date, more than 800 CubeSats have been sent to space. They have tested navigation and control technologies that could make space experiments more affordable, for example, and demonstrated the feasibility of tracking a nearby spacecraft with an off-the-shelf automobile anticollision system.

- Small satellites are enabling new applications and business models, just as their terrestrial counterparts—the laptop and smartphone—have done, Sweeting says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n8va0zhgaz6b7s91hqzf3))
- “The emerging ‘NewSpace’ sector is vibrant, innovative, and with strong potential to change the face of the space industry and the space-enabled services for the greater benefit of the global population,” he says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0n91e177j3a318qf05kztz))
