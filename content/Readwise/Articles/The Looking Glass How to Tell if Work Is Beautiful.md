## Highlights
- What is beauty?
  **Symmetry** is beautiful, because life blooms in cycles rather than episodes.
  **Elegance** is beautiful, because everything that matters can be described in a few math equations or observed between a few kindergartners.
  **Contrast** is beautiful, because something that lacks an alternative also lacks meaning.
  **Connection** is beautiful, because the same molecule you have breathed, I have, too.
  **Rarity** is beautiful, because from the tendrils of chaos, inexplicable magic happened to bring us to this very moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcxesn3f905r0g0geaj50cn))
