## Highlights
* How do we reconcile claims of vast overstaffing with claims of vast resource scarcity?
* Both things can be true: it’s not a clear over- or under-staffing problem. It’s a problem of proportionality.
* Friedman’s tweet referencing that “when the money is flowing freely it’s easier to hire more people than deal with low performers” rings true.
* challenges of the engineer-to-manager career path; managing people is a very different skill set than being an individual contributor, and not all engineers are set up with the skills they need to succeed as managers and have those tough conversations.
* if you’re looking at a holistic allocation of resources then allocation of capital definitely needs to be considered in conjunction with allocation of people. If you are in a leadership position, think about your resource allocation and what that says about your priorities. Pay the maintainers. Pay your on-call staff. Pay your tech writers.
