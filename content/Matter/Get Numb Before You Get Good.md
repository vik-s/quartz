## Highlights
* the truth is that it doesn’t matter. There are as many reasons to fear as there are grains of sand on a beach.
* there’s a simple trick to get over the initial hump: keep doing the thing until you feel numb.
* In the case of Commonplace’s newsletter, it became ‘another thing I write on Tuesdays’. Ditto for blog writing, and podcasting, and public speaking.
* The corollary to this idea is that you can only get good at something if you’re past the numb stage.
* Or, to put this differently: focus on getting numb first. Then focus on getting good.
* don’t seek feedback. If people offer you advice, shut it out. It’s not that feedback is bad, or that advice is terrible, it’s that none of it is useful until you’re numb.
* whenever a friend asks me for advice on blogging, I tell them to just publish a post a week. I try not to give them advice about blog topics or writing techniques,
* when you’re getting your kid started in sports, do what is necessary to get them numb before you focus on improving their technique.
* When managing a content marketing team, get your podcast host to produce episodes at a weekly cadence before iterating for marketing impact.
* if aforementioned new podcast host/producer is willing to share her work on her personal social media accounts, then she’s likely numb enough or proud enough of her work to be able to iterate effectively. It's only then that I can switch to more aggressive feedback. But not before.
* Radio producer Ira Glass has a famous quote where he says:
* All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”
* Get numb, then get good.
