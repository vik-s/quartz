## Highlights
* people absorb knowledge by reading sentences. This last idea so invisibly defines the medium that it’s hard not to take for granted, which is a shame because, as we’ll see, it’s quite mistaken.
* I’ll feel I can sketch the basic claims, paint the surface; but when someone asks a basic probing question, the edifice instantly collapses. Sometimes it’s a memory issue: I simply can’t recall the relevant details. But just as often, as I grasp about, I’ll realize I had never really understood the idea in question, though I’d certainly thought I understood when I read the book.
* how much knowledge was absorbed? How many people absorbed most of the knowledge the author intended to convey? Or even just what they intended to acquire?
* books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it.
* Why lectures don’t work
* It’s easy to attend a lecture and feel that you understand, only to discover over that night’s problem set that you understood very little.
* Books don’t work for the same reason that lectures don’t work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a result, both mediums accidentally (and mostly invisibly) evolved around a theory that’s plainly false.
* You’ve probably discovered that certain strategies help you absorb new ideas: solving interesting problems, writing chapter summaries, doing creative projects, etc.
* There’s a reason they work (when they do): they’re leveraging some underlying truth about your cognition—about the way you think and learn.
* If we collect enough of these underlying “truths,” some shared themes might emerge, suggesting a more coherent theory of how learning happens. We’ll call such theories cognitive models.
* In learning sciences, we call this model “transmissionism.” It’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another.
* The idea is so thoroughly discredited that “transmissionism” is only used pejoratively, in reference to naive historical teaching practices.
* understanding actually comes after the lecture, when attendees solve problem sets, write essays, etc. The lecture provides the raw information for those later activities.
* so wouldn’t we want to interleave the problem-solving sessions with the lecture?
* to understand something, you must actively engage with it.
* If we really wanted to adopt the better model, we’d ditch the lectures, and indeed, that’s what’s been happening in US K–12 education.
* Readers can’t just read the words. They have to really think about them. Maybe take some notes. Discuss with others. Write an essay in response. Like a lecture, a book is a warmup for the thinking that happens later. Great: that’s a better model! Let’s look at
* some people do absorb knowledge from books. Indeed, those are the people who really do think about what they’re reading.
* If they take some notes, they’re not simply transcribing the author’s words: they’re summarizing, synthesizing, analyzing.
* Readers must understand their own cognition.
* These skills fall into a bucket which learning science calls “metacognition.”
* great authors earnestly want readers to think carefully about their words. These authors form sophisticated pictures of their readers’ evolving conceptions. They anticipate confusions readers might have, then shape their prose to acknowledge and mitigate those issues. They make constant choices about depth and detail using these models. They suggest what background knowledge might be needed for certain passages and where to go to get it. By shouldering some of readers’ self-monitoring and regulation, these authors’ efforts can indeed lighten the metacognitive burden. But metacognition is an inherently dynamic process, evolving continuously as readers’ own conceptions evolve.
* The reader must plan and steer their own feedback loops.
* In fact, this kind of meta-processing of material—designing one’s own questions and generating one’s own feedback—are sometimes effective cognitive strategies. But as far as learning science understands it, they’re only effective for people who are already proficient with both the object-level concepts and also the relevant metacognitive skills.
* textbooks usually are built around explicit cognitive models.
* For instance, they often alternate between explanations which introduce concepts, and exercises which push students to think about those concepts in specific ways.
* It’s striking that academic courses are often structured around textbooks, but lots of people spend the extra time and money to enroll in those courses—rather than just studying the textbooks independently.
* by shouldering some of the metacognition, courses preserve more of students’ attention for the material itself.
* class discussions support social learning:
* Courses can provide a personal relationship with a disciplinary expert,
* courses offer a helpful accountability structure,
* Courses also offer emotional salience,
* I propose: we don’t necessarily have to make books work. We can make new forms instead.
* part of “what’s necessary to understand” something is that most of its prerequisites must be not just familiar but fluent, encoded in long-term memory.
* To help people encode more into long-term memory, we can draw on another powerful idea from cognitive science: spaced repetition. By re-testing yourself on material you’ve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memoryFor
