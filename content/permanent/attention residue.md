Long stretches of time are required to enter intense focus modes and get [[permanent/deep work]] done, because of attention residue left in the mind when switching over from a previous task. It takes a while for the attention residue to fade away before you can completely focus on the task at hand. It is for this reason that [[multi-tasking]] is an ineffective method that reduces work output greatly.
