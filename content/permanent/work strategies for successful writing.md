1. Do not multi-task. Dedicate your focus on the task.
2. Different kinds of reading (textbook, blog, article, etc) and different aspects of writing (draft, writing, proof, etc) require different kinds of attention.
3. Avoid following prescribed strategies to be a succesful writing, and develop your own through experience and failure. Become an expert.
4. Break up tasks into smaller pieces and work on them to completion. Capture thoughts along the way.
5. Focus on the creation aspect, not the workflow, and work on what you feel like. Minimize the need for willpower.
6. Look at the topics where your notes cluster; that dictates the topic you will write on
7. Write for multiple projects concurrently switching between them as often as you like
8. Never fear to cut text, recreate drafts and rewrite as many times as necessary
