Matching a transistor at its output for maximum power output can give significantly higher output power compared to a conjugate match. Conjugate match most often provides higher gain at lower input power, where non-linearity has not become significant.

In the example above, S22 match clearly gives better gain at lower power, but by matching for power, both the points of weak nonlinearity A, and moderate nonlinearity B are improved by about 2 dB. This means that the more power is delivered to the load.
