Creativity comes from the uniqueness of your experience, and your own interpretation of reality much like a dress made from the fabric of your own existence. When you sit down to create, just let it come to you, accept the outcome without judgement or bias. Abandon all pre-conceived notions of what is acceptable and what is not, know that you do not have to conform to a collective norm. Just do what you are there to do.

For a writer, a daily journal with zero intention to publish is a great starting point. For a musician, a simple experiment with chord progression or a tune can be a starting point.
