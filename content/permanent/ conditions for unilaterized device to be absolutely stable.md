The necessary and sufficient conditions for a [[permanent/unilateral device|unilateral device]] to be absolutely stable are:
1. [[Mason's Invariant U]] is positive and at least one of the two resistances below are positive
	1. $R_{11}=Re[Z_{11}]$
	2. $R_{22}=Re[Z_{22}]$
2. [[Mason's Invariant U]] is greater than unity (when netiher $R_{11}$ nor $R_{22}$ is positive)

Here $[Z]$ is the Z-parameters of the device under study, like a transistor.
