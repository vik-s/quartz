## Richard Feynman and writing
“Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted
to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” 

“No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.” 

“Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.” 

“No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”
