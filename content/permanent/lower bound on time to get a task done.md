There are certain tasks that take a minimum amount of time to complete successfully. These cannot be rushed, and productivity hacks cannot be applied to finish the task any faster. The german word for this is "Eigenzeit" - Eigen means one's own, Zeit means time. A task will take the time it needs. Any sooner, and the quality of the output will be degraded.
