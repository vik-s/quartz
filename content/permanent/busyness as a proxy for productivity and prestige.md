Due to [[the metric black hole in knowledge work]], being visibly busy by attending meetings, sending emails and messages instantly, and spending a lot of time in shallow work has become a viable option to prove to management that you are productive, even if you have nothing to show for it. [[literature/B-Newport-DeepWork]] argues that this is counter-productive to both the individual and the organization considering [[the value of deep work]].

Busyness has also become a form of prestige, where people boast that they have meetings they attend all day, in all time zones. Often even stating that they do not have time to do any real work. This has become an accepted notion in our modern corporate society.
