Writing must be done everyday to be effective. Many great writers have done this in the past.

Here are some strategies to form a writing habit:

- Do distraction-free tasks to let your mind wander
	- walks, showers, chores, gardening
- Have a method to capture ideas anywhere
	- notebook, audio recorder
- Write everyday
	- fixed time period, no excuses
	- do not worry about content quality
- Avoid distractions
	- use focus modes, take retreats, no email or IM
- Allow your mind to create without fear of judgment
	- don't worry about seeming ignorant
	- create what resonates 
	- don't worry about what others think
- Seek objective feedback
	- What 10% must I keep?
	- What 20% should I cut immediately?
	- At what points did you not understand, or your mind started to wander?
