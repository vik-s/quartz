The Warburg Effect is a phenomenon that occurs almost universally among all cancer cells, where the cells behave as if they are deprived of oxygen (even if they are not) and are in a state of metabolic energy where energy needs to be produced immediately by breaking down glucose into lactic acid, a process of fermentation, much like what happens in muscles when they are pushed to their limit during exercise. 

In this environment, the cells prioritize the building of more cells which is one of the early directives from embryonic development, instead of simply stripping away the electrons for the generation of ATP in the mitochondria. It seems that even more cells proliferate using this mechanism, giving rise to more cancerous cells.
