### What is your thought?
---
 - people want to see the summary first
- Immediate dompamine hit of wanting to know the answer
- No slide should be too detailed or it will slip right past the audiences understanding 
-  Reduce all complexity to a simple table even if it dilutes the data being represented
- Is this a consequence of our social media providing instant dopamine hits via twitter, IG and TikTok?
- How has the length of pornographic videos evolved with the uptick of social media? Have they gotten shorter?
- Another example is the availability of platforms that summarize books for you. How can someone else summarize your thoughts from a book? When you read a book, you make connections to your existing thoughts, and that is what develops insight. This is because people dont have the attention span to sit down and completely absorb a book.

“We also know that the average
length of TV soundbites has steadily declined over the last several decades (Fehrmann,
2011). During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the average soundbite —
that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted — was still a little
more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10 seconds at the end of
the 80s (Hallin 1994) and 7.8 seconds in 2000 (Lichter, 2001).”
