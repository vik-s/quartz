In order to place an emphasis on [[permanent/Productivity|productivity]], and eliminate the [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work|need for willpower]] to sink into periods of [[permanent/deep work|deep work]], create a pre-work ritual that eliminates all friction in getting the work done, to emphasize the [[perceived importance of a task]].

Some things to ritualize can be:

1. Time-based rules - when to begin work, how long to work
2. Interaction rules - no internet access, or interpersonal communication
3. Output rules - generate certain words per hour, or other known metrics
4. Environment rules - Proper stationery, computer peripherals, minimal running programs
5. Personal rules - Cup of coffee, fill water bottle, use bathroom in advance
