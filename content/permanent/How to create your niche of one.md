- Pick something you excel at
	- Most people have at least one thing they are naturally inclined to do
- Choose something you are interested in
	- You have to create this for a long time, so it should be something that motivates you
- Combine the above two
	- This is where something unique emerges
	- Be creative about this
	- What skills of yours can you combine to create something new?
- Create a distribution system
	- Just creating something cool is not enough if you don't share it in the correct channels
	- Focus on the following
		- Personal blog or newsletter
		- Social media (likely LinkedIn)
		- Industry sites (like EEtimes or Semiweekly)
	- An audience will start to form
- Ask them what they need
	- Once you have a following you have the opportunity to create something of direct value
	- Ask what problems people are facing and tailor your content accordingly.
