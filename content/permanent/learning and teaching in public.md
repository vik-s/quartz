Share what you learn, and teach others what you know online (in public). Connect your learning/teaching to personal anecdotes so that audiences can relate to it.

The advantages of doing there are several:

- You grow you personal brand and develop your special niche
- You develop the confidence to be publicly wrong, and do not worry about perfection
- You can help others solve problems and generate value
- Feedback from others will accelerate your growth
- You will stay motivated to keep learning
- Build connections, sponsorships and interviews
