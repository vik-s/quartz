Learning to neglect the right things, or *the art of creative neglect* is a valuable tool that can drive us towards during what is valuable to us, with our time. 

- Pay yourself first when it comes to time
	- Use your best and most focused hours in a day to do what is most important to you.
	- It is not necessary that your career should always be deserving of your best quality time. If you have a creative project that you've been looking to start, which will add meaning to your life, it is best to dedicate some of your best time to it.
	- Avoid waiting for the right moment; begin today, however small.
- Limit your number of concurrent projects
	- Avoid having more than three managable, well-defined, concurrent projects
	- Never leave projects half-finished. Either complete it, or abandon it if it is not working out.
- Learn to say **no** to projects you *do* want to do
	- Charlie Munger said, list the top 25 things you want to, and scratch out all but 5, and work on them
	- The only way to be successful is to limit and focus prioritites
