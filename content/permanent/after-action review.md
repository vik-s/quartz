The After-Action Review (AAR) is a simple, powerful framework used by the military and leading corporations to make [[continuous improvement]] by reflecting on each completed action and distilling the relevant insights to inform future actions.

Use the following four questions to reflect on your actions.

1. What did we intend to accomplish?
2. What did we accomplish relative to our intention?
3. Why did it happen this way?
4. What will we do to adapt and refine for an improved outcome?
