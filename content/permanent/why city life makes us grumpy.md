The longer we continuously live in the city, the more we feel the need to "getaway" from it, and we then take vacations to "slow-down" and recover ourselves. But why is this?

The root of this feeling, according to German Sociologist (person:: Georg Simmel), is due to prolonged, intense, nervous stimulation, where decisions need to made rapidly from the mind, and less with their hearts. The unsustainable pace of our lives makes us intolerable to one another.

A consequence of intense nervous stimulation is that we develop a [[blase attitude]] to our lives. Our nerves are so used to being constantly agitated, that over time, we cease to react at all.
