You can deliberately work on increasing the number of chance encounters, thereby improving opportunities for [[luck]]. This note contains a running list of ways to improve luck on purpose:

1. Send one cold email / DM per day
2. Share your work and projects publicly
3. Never pass up the opportunity to meet new people
4. Never pass up the opportunity to have a new experience
