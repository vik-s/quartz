Life is too short to enjoy all the infinite experiences it has to offer. It is far better to fully and thoroughly enjoy the small fraction of experiences you actually get to do in your lifetime.

For example, when we go on vacation, we line up so many activities that the busyness of the vacation itself makes it stressful. We do this in an effort to squeeze as many experiences out of our vacation as possible. Instead, it is better to choose a few activities and enjoy them fully.
