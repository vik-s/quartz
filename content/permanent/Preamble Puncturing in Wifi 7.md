[[Wifi 7]] offers a maximum of 320 MHz for a single channel in the 6 GHz band. It can so happen that a Wifi user can occupy only 20 or 40 MHz of that channel. Preamble puncturing enables the rest of the bandwidth available on that channel to still be usable.

[[Preamble Puncturing]] is a mandatory requirement of Wifi 7, and optional in Wifi 6. In previous Wifi generations, the entire bandwidth of the channel will have to be scaled back affect users' connection speeds.
