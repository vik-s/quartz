Whenever there is a need for energy in a certain location in the body, it has to be transported to that place on demand. One example is the brain often has erratic requests for energy throughout the day, and is in general a very high consumer of energy.

Glucose is the ideal "shipping container" for energy because it is insoluable in water and can be easily transported through the blood stream.
