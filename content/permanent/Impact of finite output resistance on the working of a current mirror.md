How well a current source works depends on how the output current depends on the output terminal voltage. We assumed that the output transistor has infinite output impedance, but in reality this is not so, and the collector current usually rises with the collector voltage due to finite output impedance. As a result, the output current also ends up being higher than the reference current.
