Solopreneurs that aren't focused on a specific customer struggle to get their online business off the ground.

There are 3 ways to choose your niche:

## 1) Choose a sub-niche by audience

Clearly define the kind of audience you looking to attract. It is assumed that you have the expertise to provide this sub-nice audience

If you are an engineer looking to build an online consulting business:

Rather than targeting technology companies (broad audience), look for RF/analog companies (niche) and RF front-end design companies/groups (sub-niche).

## 2) Choose a sub-nice by product or service

You can similarly narrow down your focus based on the service or product you will create.

If you want to designing coaching for RF engineers: Rather than targeting RF engineering coaching (broad audience), you could focus on RF front end design coaching (niche), or specifically design flow solutions for RF front end coaching (sub-niche).

Now that you've identified your audience:

- Where do they hangout online?
	- Almost exclusively Linkedin
	- Maybe a little on X
- What jargon and language do they use?
	- All engineering and RF
- Are there podcasts / YouTube channels they watch?
	- Maybe the EEtimes  is one
	- IEEE spectrum, Microwave magazine and Microwave Journal are some big media outlets
- Who is already serving this audience? Who are your competitors?
	- Modelithics perhaps

## 3) Create your own niche of one

>[!definition] A "niche-of-one" is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one and then distributed through highly technical content.

When you do this well, you create a micro-niche - a category creator - best in show - the only.

Most content creators have a system. Nobody is out there winging it. Develop your system and stick with it.
