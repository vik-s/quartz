There are several philosophies of [[permanent/deep work|deep work]] you can choose from.

- Monastic
	- If your goals are so well defined that you create value from doing one thing exceptionally well, then this philosophy works best.
	- Not well suited to professions that occasionally require shallow work.
- Bimodal
	- You alternate between [[permanent/deep work|deep work]] and [[permanent/shallow work|shallow work]] by clearly defined periods of at least a day to dedicate to focus and depth.
	- The key to making this work is to ensure that you are fully available to do shallow work when your schedule dictates that you must.
- Rhythmic --> ==Most likely to be used by people==
	- This is a reduced form of bimodal, where you dedicate a few hours a day to deep work.
	- This is ideal for the office worker who needs to generate value from deep work.
	- Rhythmic cannot generate the depth even bimodal does, but it can outdo it in the sheer number of depth hours clocked due to it's routine nature.
	- You can keep deep work scorecards to motivate you to maintain deep work streaks.
- Journalistic
	- You sink into deep work any chance you get, for any period of time.
	- This is an advanced manuever not well suited to a beginner. A beginner will exhaust  [[permanent/Role of willpower in doing work|willpower]] quickly.
	- You must have full conviction that your work is of high importance, which often comes only to accomplished people.
