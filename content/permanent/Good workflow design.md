A good workflow design should:
- have a low threshold and be simple to use
- enable one to use the mind exclusively for thinking, learning, insight, and generation of ideas
- offload all other aspects of information storage and memory retrieval to an external system
- allow to jump in and out of lines of thought
- should differentiate various kinds of tasks and the kinds of attention they deserve
- make work productive and fun
