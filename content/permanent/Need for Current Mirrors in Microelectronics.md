Proper functioning of electronic circuits dictate that the bias circuits are relatively insensitive to external factors such as voltage and temperature variations. Every chip has a golden reference source for voltage and current generated by a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit, which requires several transistors and is fairly complex to implement. As a result, a design cannot have a multitude of such reference circuits in the chip, wherever a bias supply is required.

A sensible approach to the problem is to generate the golden reference voltage and current on chip using a Band Gap Reference circuit, and simply "copy" or "mirror" the current into other parts of the chip where bias supply is required. This is the main purpose of a [[permanent/Current Mirror]]. In addition, they tend to have a smaller footprint compared to resistor-based techniques especially when small currents are involved.
