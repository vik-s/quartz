[[permanent/Conventional writing methods are flawed right from the start|Much like in academic writing]], never start music composition from a blank slate. Make it a habit to create small pieces of music everyday and store it as music notes. Putting together a composition should involve merely piecing together music notes for a first draft, and then further refinement to the composition can be performed to make it a cohesive piece.
