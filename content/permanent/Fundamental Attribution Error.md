Fundamental Attribution Error is a cognitive bias whereby humans tend to hold others to the fire (while giving ourselves a break).

It says that we:

1. Attribute the flawed actions of others to their character (and not to their situation or context).
2. Attribute our own flawed actions to situation and context (and not to our character).
