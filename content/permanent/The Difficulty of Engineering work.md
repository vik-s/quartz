A lot of people steer away from engineering education for one reason. It's hard.

- Learning engineering is slow 
- Engineering information is dense
- Engineering is hard to understand
- Doing engineering is even harder
- Others seem smarter than you

It is all worth it, and let me explain why.

- You will learn to learn
- Riches are in the niches
- Doing hard stuff makes you stand out
- Be humbled by how little you still know
- Have confidence you can start anything from zero

When I see people talk about why they don't want to do engineering, it is always a combination of

1) I am not smart enough
2) I will lose my mental stability

If you can't bet on yourself and believe in your own abilities, then the rest of the world won't either. This applies no matter what profession you choose.
