A metric black hole is used to describe something that cannot be quantified effectively, but still has an important impact on the revenue of a business.

One example is the balance between [[permanent/deep work|deep work]] and [[permanent/shallow work|shallow work]] in the work place. The trend of being always connected and instantly available gives rise to distractions that impacts work output and as a result, revenue of a business. But this cannot be quantified.
