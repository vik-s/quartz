- Always read with a pen (or keyboard) in hand. The end goal is to create permanent notes in the slipbox
- Elaborate **in your own words** what you have understood from reading
	- Make it as detailed as it needs to be
		- Technical texts can be very detailed
		- Self help books can be reduced to a sentence
	- Teach the subject to your future self
		- Include sufficient detail that it will make sense later
- Test your self on the material and think beyond the text
	- Elaboration is a way of testing your understanding
	- Identify how it connects to what you already know
- Practice extracting the gist from reading something
	- Be it a paragraph, section or chapter, step back and ask yourself what was just explained to you
	- Ask what is  not being said too
	- Don't hear the author's voice in your head; learn to think as you read and develop your own inner voice
- Capture all information from what you read, and not just what you agree with
- Create abstractions from what you read to a context that is more general than the one you encountered an idea in.
