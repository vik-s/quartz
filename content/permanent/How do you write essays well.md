Essays start with a question. You should have some unique way of approaching that question. You should also be interested in it. By exploring the answer to that question, you discover ideas.

Even if you fill in the gaps to questions people often take for granted, you have made progress.

As you write, you face several possible responses and you need to make a choice. The choice should be based on whichever one offers the best generality and novelty.

As you progress, don't worry if you're sticking to the original question. Go with it and see what comes of it. Take risks.

Questions that are naughty, counterintuitive or overambitious in some way are the most interesting ones.

Do not hesitate to cut your writing and revise as many times as necessary. Be ruthless if there are gaps between your writing and the truth.

Your writing might have several branches. Choose the most general and novel one. Cut everything else.
