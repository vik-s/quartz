People try to learn everything they can about YouTube, before making their first video. People try to read everything about business before starting their first business. We read countless books, watch endless videos, and consume all the information we can find, all before actually starting to do the thing we want to learn.

But, the truth is, the best way to learn is through action.

I was reminded of this story when listening to this [amazing 3 hour conversation between Dan Koe and Dickie Bush](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zlumqmxxm2inh4odgr8bp/9qhzhnhpk92rmnsz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1WNFRYbnZyaHVadw==) earlier in the week. They talk about a bunch of interesting stuff, including this idea that we should always look to take action first and allow experience to be the foundation of learning.

Of course, we shouldn’t ignore learning entirely, but it shouldn’t be our main focus. The focus should be on getting experience, knowing that the knowledge we need will come with time.
