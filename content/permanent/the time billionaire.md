Graham Duncan, the co-founder of East Rock Capital, appeared on an [episode](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9qonn4whqhkr3oqxhg/p8heh9hz3zn399iq/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW0uYmxvZy8yMDE5LzAzLzAxL3RoZS10aW0tZmVycmlzcy1zaG93LXRyYW5zY3JpcHRzLWdyYWhhbS1kdW5jYW4tMzYyLw==) of The Tim Ferriss Show. During the conversation, Duncan proposed a concept: The Time Billionaire.

> [!quote] A million seconds is 11 days. A billion seconds is slightly over 31 years...I feel like in our culture, we’re so obsessed, as a culture, with money. And we deify dollar billionaires in a way...And I was thinking of time billionaires that when I see, sometimes, 20-year-olds—the thought I had was they probably have two billion seconds left. But they aren’t relating to themselves as time billionaires.

When you are young, you are literally rich with time. At 20, you have 2 billion seconds left. At 50, you just have 1 billion. We don't relate ourselves to the billionaires we actually are, and we fail to realize this asset till it's really gone.

Being a “Time Billionaire” isn’t necessarily about having the actual time, but about the awareness of the precious nature of the time you do have. It is about embracing the shortness of life and finding joy in ordinary daily moments of beauty.
