Studies have shown that the most creative people in history switch between wide-open and playful mindsets and narrow, work focused modes of work. This is also refered to in the book "Hyperfocus" by Bailey where he talks about alternating between [[deep work]] mode (hyperfocus) and wandering mind mode (scatterfocus).

It is also essential to understand that different kinds of work needs different kinds of focus. For example, outlining an article vs writing vs proof reading. Or in music, song structure, riff ideas, performance, production.
