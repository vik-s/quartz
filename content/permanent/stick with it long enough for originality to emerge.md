To create original work takes time, and is often the result of doing something far longer than others will tolerate and accepting the discomfort of not being in control throughout.

The following will help you "stay on the bus" longer than your peers:

1. Learn to love and relish the hard problems
2. Get a little better at something everyday
3. Dedicate a time slot to work on your project, but walk away when the time is up
4. It is far more important to be consistent than producing a lot of work in a single day
