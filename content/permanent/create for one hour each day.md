Creating something for one hour each day puts you ahead of most people out there who spend thier time consuming more than creating. The key is to slip into a [[flow state]] and have one hour of [[deep work]].

Here are 3 tips to make the most out of your hour:

1. Eliminate all distractions to avoid pivoting your attention to something that is easier to do
2. When stuck, get up and move your body. It moves the mind.
3. At the end of the hour, get something out, even if it feels like gibberish.

Have the committment to create something. Slowly but surely something worth creating will eventually emerge.
