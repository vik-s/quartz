Here are some reasons people do not embrace [[permanent/deep work|deep work]]:

- Principle of least resistance
	- Can get answers immediately via messaging, without prior work planning
	- Setting up weekly sync meetings as a way to keep their own work accountable
- Busyness as a proxy for productivity
	- With [[permanent/metric black hole|metric black holes]] in knowledge work, it is hard to show you've been productive
	- Being visibly busy via email and chat is one way to show you're working hard
- The cult of the internet
	- We assume that anything high tech is good for us without considering the consequencies of technology
