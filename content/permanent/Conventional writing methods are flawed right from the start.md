The conventional academic research workflow suggests that you first pick a topic to work on, do the necessary research, think about creative solutions, and consolidate your findings in writing.

There are drawbacks to this method:
1. Choosing a topic purely from your temporary memory is very unreliable because the [[feature positive effect gives undue importance to recent information]]
2. Picking a topic is hard to do without reading and understanding
3. It is demotivating to realize during the research phase that the topic choice was incorrect or uninteresting
4. You are faced with a blank screen when you start writing which makes getting started difficult
