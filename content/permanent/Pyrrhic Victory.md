In the 3rd century BC, King Pyrrhus of Epirus, a Greek king, led a series of valiant military campaigns against his Roman enemies. One battle, which was fought on a plain near the town of Heraclea, was extremely brutal. King Pyrrhus was able to declare victory, but at an exceptionally high cost, with losses of many of his best soldiers, including his lead general.

At the end of the battle, King Pyrrhus is said to have exclaimed, “Another such victory and we are undone!”

His hand effectively forced by the cost of these “victories”, King Pyrrhus of Epirus withdrew from Italy and returned home, where he would wage a few inconsequential campaigns before dying in relative obscurity in a battle five years later.

The term “Pyrrhic Victory” now refers to the victory won at such a steep cost to the victor that it feels like a defeat. The victory that damages the victor beyond repair—the battle won, but the war lost. 

Imagine your professional dream is to be a CEO. You grind your way through the years and make it to the top—you’re the CEO of a big company!

But along the way, you gain weight from the crazy work hours, drink too much from all the nights out, see your marriage fall apart from the stress you bring home at night, and fail to build a meaningful relationship with your kids because of all the travel.

The classic Pyrrhic Victory: You won the battle (becoming a CEO) but lost the war (building a balanced and fulfilling life).
