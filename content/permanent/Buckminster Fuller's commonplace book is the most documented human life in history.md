The [[Dymaxion]] chronofile is (person:: Buckminster Fuller)'s attempt to document his life as completely as possible. The total collection is estimated to be 270 feet (80 m) worth of paper. This is said to be the most documented human life in history. His [[commonplace book]] is basically a scrapbook where he documented his whole life. It contains all correspondence, bills, notes, sketches, and clippings from newspapers. The Chronofile is cross-referenced alphabetically using 13,500 5x8 inch index cards.

I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.
