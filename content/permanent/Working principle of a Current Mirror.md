A [[permanent/Current Mirror]] copies the golden reference current $I_{ref}$ generated by a [[Band Gap Reference]] circuit.

## Explanation

- The purpose of transistor Q1 is to generate an output voltage at its base that is proportional to the input current at the collector. In a [[MOS Transistor]], a gate voltage will be generated proportional to the drain current. The reference current is converted to a voltage.
- The purpose of transistor Q2 is to use the generated voltage at its base/gate, to create a replica current of $I_{ref}$ at its collector/drain.
- If the properties of Q1 and Q2 are exactly the same, an identical current is copied or mirrored to the output transistor.

## Equations

Transistor Q1 is diode-connected which means that the collector-base voltage is zero. Q1 and Q2 share the same base-emitter voltage. Assume that the output impedance of Q2 is infinite. The voltage to turn on transistor Q1 is $V_{BE(on)}$ .

If the transistors Q1 and Q2 are equal,
$I_{c1} = I_{c2}$  and $I_{b1}=I_{b2}=I_{c1}/\beta_f$ 

Summing currents at the collector of Q1,
$I_{ref} - I_{c1} -I_{b1} - I_{b2} = 0$

Substituting for $I_{b1}$ and $I_{b2}$,
$I_{ref} - I_{c1}(1+2/\beta_f)=0$

or,
$I_{c1} = I_{ref}/(1+2/\beta_f)$

If $\beta_f$ >> 1, then $I_{c1}=I_{c2}=I_{ref}$

Hence, to refer the current back to the supply voltages,
$$
I_{c2}=
\frac{V_{ref} - V_{BE(on)}}{R} = I_{ref}
$$
