(person:: Zhu Da) is a 17th century Chinese artist who would get very drunk, dip his ponytail hair in a bucket of ink, and splash it on a blank canvas.

Next morning, he would examine the swishes, swirls and patterns he had created. Once a picture emerged in his mind, he would fill in the details to complete the beautiful landscapes he was famous for.
