Imagine a junior locksmith who initially takes about an hour to complete a basic lock fixing task for the customer. The customer pays $100 for the task and is happy with the service.

The junior locksmith continues to perform this basic lock fixing task on a regular basis. By the following year, the junior locksmith is now a senior locksmith.

The same customer calls the locksmith back for another basic lock fixing task. Due to the accumulated experience, the senior locksmith is able to complete the task as before in just 30 minutes this time. He asks for his $100 and the customer stares at him, confused.

The locksmith has improved at his craft, but the customer has become increasingly upset by the lower time input required to deliver the fixed output.

The results are the same, but the customer's perception of value changed
