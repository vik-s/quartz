Momento Mori - Remember that you will die.

We are often not reminded of this until we face death in our lives through the loss of someone dear to us. Up until that point, we proceed with our fast paced life without stopping to think.

Our life is like a conveyor belt on which tasks keep on coming, and we get each one done in the least time possible using productivity tools, but find that the conveyor belt has started moving faster. We work even harder hoping that one day, the conveyor belt will stop and we will finally get to do what we want. Unfortunately, for many, this moment of freedom never arrives.
