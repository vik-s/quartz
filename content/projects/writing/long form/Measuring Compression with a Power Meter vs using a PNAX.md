PNAX measures fundamental RF power in a narrow bandwidth around the tone. As a result, the compression occurs faster than when measuring with a Power Meter, because the power meter usually measures power across a much wider bandwidth. So measured power is integrated over a large bandwidth to also include the harmonic tones. As a result you will not see a rapid drop in compression.

The argument is that PNAX measurement is more accurate and much more closer to reality because the harmonics are usually filtered out in a system, much like a PNAX does. But manufacturers "cheat" by reporting compression with a power meter measurement because it gives better numbers.
