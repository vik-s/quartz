Transmission lines are everywhere whether you realize or not.

They are used to transport electrical signals over long distances like those high voltage lines that transport electricity to your home. Or they can be designed to carry high frequency signals over microscopic distances like in an integrated circuit.

Either way, having some transmission line fundamentals under your belt will prove useful if you are an electrical engineer. After reading this, you will be able to answer the following regarding Transmission Lines:

1. What is it and what are the different kinds?
2. What are some key parameters and what do they mean?
3. How is it represented in a smith chart?
4. What are some simple applications in a microwave circuit?

Let's dive in!

### Transmission line fundamentals

A transmission line is defined as:

> [!definiton]
Two or more conducting wires that carry an alternating electrical signal that is physically much larger than the wavelength of the signal.

The relative physical size compared to wavelength (also called electrical size) is what prevents us from describing transmission lines with a simple circuit network. Due to electrical size, we need to represent transmission lines with a *distributed network* on a "per-unit-length" basis. 

We can associate a resistance, inductance, capacitance and conductance per-unit-length (R, L, G, C) for this transmission line. Now take a long transmission line and zoom in on a tiny slice of length \Deltaz of it and it's equivalent circuit representation is shown in Figure X. We will need this circuit in the next section to define some key parameters, but more on that in a bit.

Here are some kinds of transmission lines you should know about (add a pic showing each):

1. Coaxial - It has a center core conductor and a metallic shield separated by insulator. It is widely used in CATV distribution, internet access and radio communication equipment.
2. Microstrip -
3. Stripline
4. Coplanar waveguide
