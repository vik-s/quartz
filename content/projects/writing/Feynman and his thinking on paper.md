Richard Feynman, the Nobel prize winning physicist, once had a visitor in his office - a historian who wanted to interview him. When he looked at Feynman’s table full of his notebooks, he said how great it is to see “wonderful records of a genius’ thinking”.

“No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking. They are my thinking process!”

“Well, you did the work in your head, but this is the record of it right?,” the historian said.

To this Feynman said, “No, it’s not a record, you have to think on paper, and this is the paper!”

Thinking is writing. The first does not exist without the second.
