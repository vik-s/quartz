Thank you to everyone for their overwhelming positive support for my upcoming newsletter! No better day in the year to say it!

I figured I'll explain a bit more about why I decided to write one.

1Ô∏è‚É£ A reason to learn more

I've been doing Electrical Engineering for 20 years and I still haven't even scraped it's surface. Some of the best days in all those years are when I learned something new. If I had a reason to learn something everyday, my days would be so much more fun.

A newsletter gives me an outlet to learn and share it with everybody.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Disaster preparedness

I've never kept good notes of all my EE education over the years. I don't use all of what I have learned everyday, and what is not used is forgotten. There comes a time when everyone needs to interview for a new position - of their own volition or not. 

A newsletter is a way to rebuild my knowledge vault and share it, so others may also benefit from it.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Online community

My curious forays into software engineering showed me the wealth of knowledge available via blogs and newsletters. Hardware engineering does not even come close to having those kinds of online resources. I believe it is partially because there are fewer people doing say EE, rather than software.

A newsletter is a way to build a community of like minded people online.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Make it fun

Learning even basic EE involves so many equations from the get go, it poses a barrier for many of us to open up those textbooks and learn. We all have jobs, families or coursework already. I do believe EE concepts can be explained more simply with better analogies.

A newsletter is a challenge to explain topics so that a reader can understand it in 5 minutes.
