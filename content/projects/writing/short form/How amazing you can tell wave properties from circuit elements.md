You tell me what the dimensions of the line are, I'll tell you how fast the signal travels. I'm amazed this can even be calculated.

Transmission lines seem simple but are amazing.

From the dimensions of a coaxial line, the R-L-C-G per unit length can be calculated.

From RLCG, you calculate phase constant, and then phase velocity.

Its really cool that you can even relate wave propagation to circuit parameters.
