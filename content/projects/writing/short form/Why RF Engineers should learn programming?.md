Most RF engineers do not prioritize programming as one of their skill sets.

Instead, they manually repeat far too many tasks related to data analysis, lab measurements and format translations.

Here are 3 ways a programming language will help you as as RF engineer:

ðŸ‘‰ Data analysis

RF engineering consists of significant amounts of simulation and measurement data. Manual analysis takes too long and is often error prone. You will make fewer mistakes and get better data insights if you use a programming language for analysis and plotting.

ðŸ‘‰ Lab automations

High quality measurements of a product over voltages and temperatures takes a long time. This needs to be repeated for multiple lab samples. Automating instruments in the lab gives consistent data without user error. By running measurements over nights and weekends, utilization of expensive lab equipment is greatly enhanced.

ðŸ‘‰ CAD tool automations

Most commercially available RF engineering software from major vendors such as Ansys and Keysight have the ability to automatically perform schematic design, layout and simulation using programming interfaces. Knowing programming will help you use these tools more effectively. You can enable more complex designs and detailed simulations that are too hard to set up manually.
