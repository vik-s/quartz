A truly innovative engineer is not one who knows the topic in depth.

The greatest contributions in an engineering team are often made by those who have "fringe knowledge"

Let me explain.

A piece of engineering is considered amazing if it does what is supposed to do:
1) Consistently
2) Under most circumstances
3) While working with other pieces of engineering

An engineer who is knowledgable and detail oriented can usually achieve (1) and (2).

Not (3).

For that you need to have "fringe knowledge" - a good sense of what is on the other side, how and why the system works, and how your engineering fits in.

Consider some examples:
- If you are a front end web developer, know how the back end works
- If you are an electrical engineer, understand some heat mechanics
- If you are a marketer/salesperson, learn some product design
- If you are a teacher, learn some psychology

Unless you truly understand the fringes of your area of expertise, you will be unable to differentiate yourself from the rest.

Step outside your comfort lines, stay curious and keep learning.
