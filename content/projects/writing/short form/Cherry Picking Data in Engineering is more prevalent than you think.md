I've always enjoyed taking measurements in a lab, and still do. There's something oddly satisfying about interacting with the physical world of electronics.

A director at the company I once worked for used to jokingly ask me, "Is it good data or bad data?"

To which I always replied - "It's just data."

Data is only good or bad if you want it to fit your narrative. And herein lies the danger of interpreting data the way you want to.

It takes courage to present data that opposes the views of everybody in the room.

ðŸ”¹ You have to defend your instrument calibrations.
ðŸ”¹ You need to prove that your observations are not an outlier.
ðŸ”¹ You need a reasonable hypothesis of why its different than expected.
ðŸ”¹ You will need to revisit / redo previous measurements to double check.

After all this, you might actually have just made a mistake. It's always hard to admit.

Once burned, twice shy, you will be more careful before presenting opposing views the next time.

This is the life of an engineer. The work can be long and hard, but that's what makes great things happen in the end. It promotes personal and professional growth.

It is easy to find ways to make the data seem agreeable, but this is not what will bring out the best engineer in you. 

Resist the urge to cherry pick data, and you will be better for it.
