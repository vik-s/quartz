You are not spending as much time on personal projects as you should.

Both the company and your skillset will stand to benefit.

Here's are 4 ways you can convince your manager 👇🏼:

1) 📊 Showcase your problem solving skills

The ability to identify, triage, define and execute a solution to a problem tells a lot about your deep understanding in the field of your expertise. It shows you have both macro and micro perspectives on the topic.

2) 📈 Hands-on experience with new tech

By actually going through and completing a project, you will learn a lot of new technology, what works, what does not. Mistakes will be made, lessons will be learned. 

This feedback will help you improve outside of critical company projects where there is little leeway to try new tech.

3) 🎖️ Potential for patents and innovations


1) Good for performance reviews, internal recognitions and promotions
