Here's a simple way to supercharge your engineering learning.

Write down one thing you have learned everyday.

You would have learned 30 concepts in a month. 180 in 6 months.

- Focus on only ONE idea
- Write it in YOUR OWN WORDS
- Explain it to a 5 year old
- Keep it as short as possible
- It should not need context

Writing helps think and retain information better. With your library of learnings you can:

- Use it to write blogs/newsletters
- Share learnings on company wiki
- Prepare for future interviews
- Build and teach your own courses

The benefits are immense. Give it a shot!
