Samuel J. Mason had the most bass-ackwards approach to identify a fundamental property of linear two-port networks.

What most people would do-
Find the expression for power gain of a linear 2-port, maximize it and prove that it's an invariant property.

What Mason did-
Search for an arbitrary invariant network property of a linear 2-port, identify it, and show that it is power gain.

This quantity is now called Mason's Unilateral Gain.

Here's what you have to do to get it.

1) Take an active device like a transistor
2) Wrap it in a special circuit that is linear, lossless and reciprocal
3) Do it in a way that device+circuit gives Z12=0
4) Make sure the resulting network is still stable
5) Conjugate match the input and output terminals

The power gain you get out of this is Unilateral Gain.

The amazing thing about this quantity is this:

It is a fundamental property of the core device, and does not vary with how the "special circuit" is implemented. 

This is why it is often called "Mason's Invariant Gain."
