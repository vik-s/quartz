Use engineering flywheels to greatly increase your work or team output.

Engineering work is resource intensive and sometimes there is no capacity to throw more inputs into a project on a deadline. This is true at a personal or engineering organization level.

This is where flywheels put into place greatly help.

Flywheels are systems that provide continuous power output when input to the system is not continuous. They are hard to get started, but are easy to keep going once in motion.

These are systems that do the work for you, when you cannot. But they need time to setup before they produce outputs.

Here are some examples:
- IP block reuse of known, tested designs
- Lab automations for standardized measurement
- CAD automations to enable extensive simulations and scheduling
- Standardized documentation requirements for design reviews and testing

It all comes down to how much time you take on a tasks versus how often you do it. The classic xkcd comic below explains it all.

What flywheel systems do you use?
