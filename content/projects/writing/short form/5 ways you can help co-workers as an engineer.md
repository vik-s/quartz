There are always people who are smarter, faster and better than you. 

Stand out as an engineer by being the most helpful one.

Here are 5 ways how: üëáüèº

**Document effectively:** 
Most people run into the same issues at work. You need to redo something you figured out last time. Document effectively so that you don't have to rediscover it every time. Share it with others to save them time.

How-tos, cheat sheets, templates, code repos are all ways to provide people tools to help them do their work better. Maintain them centrally so every one can access them.
   
**Offer constructive feedback:** 
If you know of ways to do something more efficiently based on your prior experience, share it with others including why you think its better. Show them an example if possible. Offer to help resolve any questions. Be open to more discussions. Be vested in the success of your coworkers.

By showing them you care, you send a clearly signal that you're not ordering anyone around but being supportive in their work.
    
**Mentor junior members:** 
If you are a mid or senior level engineer, offer provide guidance to junior coworkers. Most young engineers don't know they will benefit from mentorship, so offer it to them. Teach them whatever you have picked up along the way - engineering practices, good resources, corporate culture, managing up and whatever else will provide value to them.

Pay it forward and your mentees will do the same when they get to where you are.
    
**Communicate well:** 
Good intentions that are not communicated are of no use. Ask how you can help, follow up on how your coworkers' projects are progressing,
    
**Promote good work hygiene:** 

    

In a tech world full of noise, be the signal that guides your team to success.
