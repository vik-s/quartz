Whenever I run into a hard problem at work, I use the following method to chip away at the problem. It does not always result in a solution, but I definitely make progress.

Here is how I go about it:

1. **Write down the problem in words** so that you can explain it to someone who does not understand all the finer details like you do. Write down why you think it is happening, what are the possible causes and if it has happened on multiple occasions.
2. **Write down the ideal outcome** when you have solved the problem. Sure, the problem has gone away, but what other benefits would it bring if it does? Where else do you think the solution would apply? What other avenues would open up if this problem went away?
3. **List out 3 possible root causes**, and write down what would need to prove true or false to prove or disprove each of the 3 root causes is causing the problem. Order them in increasing order of complexity, and start working on the easiest one. Occam's razor suggests that the simplest answer of often the right one.
4. **Recreate a simple scenario for each case**. Design a way to test each root cause hypothesis. It is difficult to debug problems in-situ, so you have to find a way to emulate the same issue in a simpler situation.
5. **Try to solve each simple scenario**. Use all the tools and turn all the knobs available to you to solve each simple scenario. Do those knobs exist in the big problem? Is something else determining the status of those knobs? If so what?
6. **Implement any simple solutions you found** on the big problem and see what the results are. Chances are there are more confounding variables in the big situation. Can you implement more than one simple solution to take care of inter dependencies?

By this time, even if you have not solved the problem, you will have greater insight than when you started out and would be one step closer to solving the problem.
