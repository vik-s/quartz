## Endless Idea Generator

Ask the following questions:

1. Who am I writing for?
2. So that they can do what?

Topic = Therapy
For who = Stressed out dads who work in corporate careers
So that = They can stop taking their stress out on family

Then use the 4A framework:

1. **Actionable**: Here's how
2. **Analytical**: Here's the breakdown
3. **Aspirational**: I did, you can too
4. **Anthropological**: Psychology behind why

You can address any topic in one of the 4A angles.

*GPT prompt*:

I am going to train you to become an Endless Idea Generation Machine. 

Here's how it works: there are 4 types of ideas we can generate. 

The 4 primary types of ideas are: 
- Actionable 
- Analytical 
- Aspirational 
- Anthropological 

Then there are sub-topics within each of these buckets: 

Actionable (here's how) 
- Tips 
- Tools 
- Hacks 
- Advice 
- Resources 
- Frameworks 
- Ultimate Guides 
- Curation (the best books/podcasts/threads) 

Analytical (here's a breakdown) 
- Trends 
- Numbers 
- Reasons 
- Examples 
- Teardowns 
- Swipe files 

Aspirational (yes, you can) 
- Lessons 
- Mistakes 
- Reflections 
- Personal stories 
- Stories of growth 
- Underrated traits 
- Advice to past self 

Anthropological (here’s why) 
- Fears 
- Failures 
- Struggles 
- Paradoxes 
- Observations 
- Comparisons 
- Why others are wrong 
- Why you’ve been misled 

I am going to give you a Topic, an audience (FOR WHO), and an outcome that audience desires (SO THAT), and you are going to generate 1 idea (written in the form of a headline) for each of these sub-topics above—organized the same way I have here. 

Do you understand?

## Short Form: Outlines as Content

Start with a clear headline 

Topic + For who + So that

The goal is to write a long form headline that is incredibly specific to that point that you cant get any more specific at all.

Example: I want to write about what finance-related questions to ask current owners of rental properties to figure out whether it’s a good deal or not—specifically for properties in Miami, Florida—so that you know you are buying a property you can rent profitably AND flip for sale in 2 years or less.

When you have something this specific, it's time to *create short form tweet*

There are a million possible things related to your topic you could give them—you don’t have to just give the reader a list of tips.<br><br>- Give them the **steps**<br>- List all the **questions**<br>- Curate all the **tools**<br>- Name the **mistakes**

*GPT prompt*:

I am going to train you to write short-form content (280 characters or less). 

Here are the rules: 
1. It must open with an encouraging sentence 
2. 3-5 succinct bullets organized in a list 
3. Do not use hashtags and emojis. Ever. 

I am going to give you the headline and you are going to write a short-form piece based on that headline.
