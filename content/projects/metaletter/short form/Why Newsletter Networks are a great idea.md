- I wonder why no one has yet formed “newsletter networks” where one fixed $ per month gets you a bunch of similar minded newsletters. Its like newsletter Cable TV
- Nobody wants to watch (read) the same thing every time; sometimes you want sports, sometimes you want tech, sometimes you want a tv show.
- A newsletter network can comprise of 1) a business letter 2) a deep tech letter 3) an investing markets letter 4) a lifestyle letter
- Charge $25 for the bundle
- I can run all 4 substacks under ViksNewsletter
