The cautionary tale of X and X^2. 👇🏼

Of course everybody wants to be X^2. 

Because X-squared is greater than X. Right? Yes, but only for X>1.

Sadly nobody starts from 1. We all start from 0.

For 0 < X < 1, X > X^2.
- People who are X, laugh at those who are X^2.
- X^2 wants to do better in life, and tries hard to become like X.

X^2 works hard, night and day. Finally makes it the level of X. At X=1.

Ignition. The exponential rise of X-squared begins.

X worships X^2; calls it lucky, and invents a hundred reasons why it couldn't be like X^2.

X^2 is so far ahead, there's no looking back.

If you feel like X^2, stick it out. Your rewards await.






- Everybody knows that X2 > X for X>1. Every one wants to grow exponentially.
- Everybody wants to be X2.
- But most people dont start from 1
- They start from 0.
- For X<0, X > X2.... X2 looks all sad and low why the Xs are flying high.
- All until X=1
- The ignition point
