- Initial idea was to make it an educational newsletter
	- people cant upskill easily in hard EE fields
	- they need to read difficult text books
	- or watch boring long videos on youtube from professors on blackboard
	- my idea was to write a short piece that people can read easily every sunday
	- create a list of articles categorized by topic that people can refer when needed
- I also wanted it to be inspirational
	- something that made people excited to take up RF engineering
	- write something that stopped people from losing interest in engineering during their day to day boring job
- What did I realize from the people who subscribed
	- that most people were students from different parts of the world
	- the other category of people were junior engineers
	- this seemed to make sense considering the educational material i was putting out
	- i was not attracting too many professionals I dont think
	- I have no idea what the demographics are, since I didnt do a survey
- What was my biggest fear in choosing this niche?
	- There were a few worries:
		- My biggest fear was consistency. I was worried that I wont be able to keep up creating hard technical content.
		- Fear that my substack topic is too niche and I wont get enough subscribers, and eventually stagnate.
		- Worried that I might cross the lines of confidential information from my employer when I started writing technical content.
	- I chose it anyway because it is what I know, and providing my expertise is the best way to create value.
