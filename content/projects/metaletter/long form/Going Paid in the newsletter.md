To provide maximum access to everyone and still have the newsletter work as a side-hustle, here are a few ideas I have:

1. **Sponsorship model**: If the newsletter has enough readers, it would be a **great candidate for companies to advertise**. The readership demographic would be a targeted niche that might appeal to certain sponsors.
    
2. **Low pricing**: Price the newsletter low enough that it comes a **no brainer for everyone to subscribe** regardless of the purchasing power the reader has. The hope is that paid subscription conversion rates will be much higher. 
    
3. **Pay what you want**: If the content has helped the reader level up their career, or helped in their professional work even a single time, then the subscription would have paid for itself. **If the employer provides a learning budget, then the subscription cost can be expensed** (the company stands to benefit greatly). I can provide more perks at this tier, like exclusive access to a community, 1:1 access, and extended trial periods from sponsors' software.
