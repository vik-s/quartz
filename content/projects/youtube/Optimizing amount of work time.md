## The Idea Phase

### ðŸ’¡What is the video about?
There is an optimal number of work hours in a week to feel motivated, energetic, and avoid burnout. I want to make a video to backfill work hours after accounting for important stuff like sleep, exercise, family.

### âœ… What are some key takeaways?
Switch from a work-first mentality to a me-first mentality. Design your work around your life instead of the other way around.

### ðŸ‘¾ What are some title ideas?
- The optimal way to design your work life
- The most overlooked way to design your life
- One way to avoid burnout that nobody is talking about | Design your life
- I've prioritized work WRONGLY all my life

### ðŸŽ‡ List out some thumbnail ideas
- I'm sitting in front of a computer pulling my hair out and screaming, and an arrow points to me saying "WRONG"
- Picture of my face looking up at my brain. My brain is transparent and there is a cartoon overlay showing that only a small fraction of my mind is focused on work, and majority is occupied by other important things. Better if hair is messy. Outside my head are distractions floating around, like youtube, social media, news.
- Me being excited about icons such as notion, obsidian, pomodoro and arrow pointing to me saying "I was wrong"

### ðŸ”‘ List out potential keywords
slow-living, focus, productivity, lower stress, nature, camping, hiking, asmr

### Hook / Intro

"I wish I spent more time at work" - said no tombstone ever.

Yet, we make work central to our lives. We let relationships fail, neglect children and sever relations with people in the pursuit of a career. We can all argue that it is for the money. But is it really? We rush from one day to another, not stopping to enjoy our children as they get older, or take the time to talk to our aging parents. We don't prioritize exercise, or cooking healthy food. It's like we're rowing as quickly as possible through the river of life only to meet with a waterfall at the end.

In this video, I propose an alternative. 

### Main Content

_for the text below, I will use 24 wooden blocks with labels for each hour of the day. and group together different blocks when assigning time to work / hobbies / exercise / rest. I might line them up like dominos and knock them down when I talk about what I am doing at any given hour. show this for both the conventional approach, and the method I am proposing. i think i will also use b-roll footage of me doing stuff_

The 8 billion people on earth today are from many countries, speak many languages, follow many customs and have many beliefs. The one common thing we all have is the length of a day - 24 hours. It's how we deploy that precious resource that determines how we will live our life.

_2 years earlier_

My typical day used to look something like this. Wake up at 7am. Get a cup of coffee and check social media, read the news and browse the web. It's 8am. Change in to work wear and get to work by 9am. Work from 9am to 5pm. Am I productive for all 9 work hours? Not at all- but we'll get back to this later. Get home at 6pm. watch some TV till 7pm to "relax", rustle up some food, watch some more TV while eating. At 9pm, open up my work laptop to check some emails, get sucked into work and spend the next hour or so answering emails and trying to work on "quick stuff". My brain now has lit up like a christmas tree, so I lie in bed with my phone looking at instagram reels and youtube videos to calm it down, and before I know it, it's midnight. If I'm lucky I'll fall asleep within the hour - leaving me only 6 hours to sleep. _maybe I can play: "everyday is exactly the same" by Nine Inch Nails during this part (license permitting)_

What I was doing wrong was making work the central part of my life, and not being intentional with the rest of my day, which I spent on auto-pilot, letting social media, news and TV command my time, leaving me little time to exercise, read or work on any hobbies I wanted to. My engineering work at my employer was also not intentional. A lot of my day went into what Cal Newport calls "shallow work", like answering emails and IM's, and not planning exactly what I wanted to get done in the day. I was not making every hour very productive.

It was time I made some changes, and this is what I did.

_present day_

I asked myself, what is the most important aspects of my life I want to address in my day. 


##### Intention and Mindfulness
The first thing I experimented with is - being intentional with silence. Often the temptation is to listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks while doing work - whether it is knowledge work or just chores at home. I found that this was filling up what Chris Bailey calls "Attentional Space" in his book "Hyperfocus". Your attentional space is what you can pay at most attention to, at any given time. Whatever you are working on, let's say takes up 80% of your attentional space, the temptation is to fill the remaining 20% with something like music. What I have found is that leaving the 20% unfilled results in a lot less mental fatigue when you have some wiggle room in your attentional space. It's rather unsurprising that it is exhausting to run my mental CPU cores at maximum capacity all the time. By running my mental cores at moderate capacity helps me work for longer periods of time with greater focus, and I'm less tired at the end.

It's not like I never listen to a podcast when I am working on something. I do. But I try to make sure that what I am doing occupies relatively little attentional space. Habitual things like folding laundry, doing dishes or vacuuming usually takes little focus from the mind. At these times, I have plenty of attentional space to listen to a podcast or audiobook, and I do so if I feel like it.

When I started leaving some attentional space free and not filling it with a distraction, something interesting happened. I started to notice a lot more - the mouse clicks while I'm working, the sound of water when I'm cleaning, sounds of food cooking. It was a natural symphony that would otherwise be blocked out by the audiobook I'm listening to. It had a naturally soothing effect on my mind. I think the right word for this is mindfulness. Being mindful about what I'm doing had a way of stopping me from trying to get things done as fast as I could. I started to let things take the time they need. I was doing things I needed to get done, but without the accompanying stress.

By slowing down and doing one thing at a time, I will not listen to all the podcasts or audiobooks that I wanted to. And that's fine. I figured that I don't have to rush to consume all the content that is out there. This helped me be more picky about what I will actually listen to, and that's a good thing. Intentional silence goes a long way in making a peaceful mind.

##### Reframing expectations
My second major mindshift came when I asked my older child a question: "The floor is full of markers, paper and toys. Does it not bother you?" Then I proceeded to say - "It bothers me because the floor is where I walk, and now I'm not able to very well". His answer was - " I don't have a big enough table to work on, so this floor space is my workspace."
