In this video we are going to talk about why you need to get your 401k investments going, and the best ways to invest your money for the long haul. So lets get started.

< stick in disclaimer here >

* What is a 401k?
	* It is a retirement savings plan offered by many employers in the US that offers tax advantages for you, if you do invest in it.
- Why invest in a 401k?
	- Apart from the obvious reason that you are saving up for your retirement, there are two big benefits to contributing part of your paycheck to a 401k.
		- Save on taxes
			- By contributing to a 401k, you will pay lesser taxes to the government in any given year due to what is called a "pre-tax deduction". Let's look at an example of what that means.
				- Lets say you make $100,000 in a year, and say you effectively pay   20% or $20,000 in taxes.
				- Assuming you contributed 10% of your income to a 401k, or $10,000, that means 10% of your income is deducted from your income *before* taxes are calculated. Which means that you pay taxes on $100K-10K = $90K.
				- At a 20% effective tax rate, you would be paying $18K in taxes instead of $20K without 401k contributions.
				- So by contributing to a 401k, you've really made yourself $2K extra by not forking it over to the government. The calculations here are made simple to drive home the idea. In reality, your tax rate might be lower after you contribute to a 401k depending on what tax bracket your income falls in, after deductions.
				- If you are fortunate enough to make enough, or live well below your means to sock away  the maximum allowed contribution to a 401k, which is $22,500 in 2023, then this is the amount that you should contribute to get the maximum tax savings in any given year.
				- If you are over the age of 50, you  get to contribute another $7500 as "catch-up contributions" for a maximum of $30,000
		- Company match
			- Several employers match the 401k contributions of their employees up to a certain limit. 
			- For example, your employer might say that they match $1 for every $1 contributed up to 5% of your salary. So if you make $100,000, and contribute 10% (or $10K) to your 401k in the year, the company will match every dollar up to 5% of your salary, or $5K. In this example, you will get an extra $5K into your 401k contribution.
			-  In reality, many companies use a tiered system where they contribute lets say $1 for every $1 up to $3000, $0.5 for every $1 thereafter, which makes the calculation more complex, but in essense you get more money into your 401k. If you would like me to go into detail on 401k contribution strategies, do let me know in the comments below.
			- What is more amazing about the company match is that it is not limited by the $22,500 401k limit mentioned earlier. The company's contributions will help you save more than the 401k limit. So if the company match was an extra $5K,  your annual contributions will go up to (22.5+5)=27.5K or (30+5)=35K if you're older than 50. Now, there is still another option that allows you to reach $66,000 in annual 401k contributions, stick around to find out.
			- Should you not contribute to a 401k if you don't have a company match? No, the company match is just an added benefit. Contributing to a 401k still does save on taxes and is worth doing just for that sake. But if you do have a company match, at least contribute enough to get the free money!
- How to invest in a 401k?
	- Alright, now that we know how the 401k works, and why we should be investing in a 401k,  let's look at how to actually contribute to a 401k and how much we should be looking to save. 401k is usually set up through your employers benefits program, and if you need help getting started it is best to reach out to your benefits department in the company. You will enroll with a major brokerage firm like Vanguard, Fidelity or Scwab to name a few, and you will then be able to select a percentage of your paycheck to contribute towards a 401k. Within the 401k, you will need to select the mutual funds you want to invest in, but we will get to that in the next section. But first let's quickly look at what percentage you should set up as contributions.
	- Fundamentally, the contribution rates comes down to how much you can afford to put away, and what your monthly expenses are. So it would be best to first examine how much money you need every month to cover your needs from mortgage or rent, to groceries, childcare, medical, or discretionary expenses.
	- Recommended saving rates
		- Even if you do enroll in a 401k but don't get around to actually setting the percentage deduction, your employer will most likely auto-deduct a default percentage from your paycheck and this is often in the range of 2%. This is a really good move in my opinion, because we will immediately start saving small amounts of money even if inertia gets the better of us and we don't get around to setting percentages in a 401k.
		- If you do get around it, and if your monthy budget permits, it is generally recommended that you save at least 10% of your paycheck in a 401k. Obviously, the more the better, but that should be a good start.
	- Continuous increase program
		- As time rolls on, you want to make sure that you increase the amount of money you save in a 401k. For this reason, many employers do provide a continuous increase program where you can set what % your 401k contribution should increase every year. A good idea here is to set it to annually increase 1-2%, so that in about 5 years you are now saving 15-20% of your paycheck and well on your way to financial freedom.
