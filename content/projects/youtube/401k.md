In this video we are going to talk about why you need to get your 401k investments going, and the best ways to invest your money for the long haul. So lets get started.

First we will go through why it is important to get started early in a 401k, and then go on to how and what to actually invest in whether you are employed by a company or self employed. We will also discuss potential options for withdrawing from a 401k. Stick around to the end to find out how the wealthy can contribute far more than the standard 401k limit in any given year.

< stick in disclaimer here >

- Why invest in a 401k?
	- Apart from the obvious reason that you are creating a nest-egg for your retirement (==put some numbers to show how a portfolio can grow if getting started early==), there are two big benefits to contributing part of your paycheck to a 401k.
		- Tax shelter 
			- By contributing to a 401k, you will pay lesser taxes to the government in any given year. The amount you contribute to a 401k is deducted "pre-tax" from your gross income. Let's look at an example of what that means.
				- Lets say you make $100,000 in a year. According to 2022 tax rates, you will be in the 22% tax bracket if filing taxes with your spouse. If you did not contribute to a 401k at all, then you will be paying 22% of $100,000, which is $22,000 in taxes in 2023 (==this is not true, you have to calculate marginal rates==)
				- Assuming you contributed 10% of you income to a 401k, you will ==do the calculations==
				- So by just contributing to a 401k, you have saved $XX in taxes which you would have otherwise paid to the government. Instead, you have not only saved up for your retirement, but also saved in yearly taxes.
				- If you are fortunate enough, or live well below your means to sock away  the maximum allowed contribution to a 401k, which is $YY in 2023, then you will  actually end up saving $ZZ every year in taxes, using our example here. If you are 50 years and older, you can save an additional $7500.
		- Company match
			- Several employers match the 401k contributions of their employees to a certain limited dollar value. So even if you are unable to contribute the 401k maximum, you should strive to at least contribute a minimum percentage to get the company match. This s basically free money from your employer which you should not pass up.
			- ==Come up with a company match example==
			- What is more amazing about the company match is that it does not contribute to the $YY 401k limit mentioned earlier. The company's contributions will help you save more than the 401k limit, which is $XX in the example we looked at. Now, there is still another option that allows you to reach $70,000 in annual 401k contributions, stick around to find out.
			- Should you not contribute to a 401k if you don't have a company match? No, the company match is just an added benefit. Contributing to a 401k still does save on taxes and is worth doing just for that sake.

- How to invest in a 401k?
	- Alright, now that we know how the 401k works, and why we should be investing in a 401k,  let's look at how to actually contribute to a 401k and how much we should be looking to save. 401k is usually set up through your employers benefits program, and if you need help getting started it is best to reach out to your benefits department in the company. You will enroll with a major brokerage firm like Vanguard, Fidelty or Scwab to name a few, and you will then be able to select a percentage of your paycheck to contribute towards a 401k. Within the 401k, you will need to select the mutual funds you want to invest in, but we will get to that in the next section. But first let's quickly look at what percentage you should set up as contributions.
	- Fundamentally, the contribution rates comes down to how much you can afford to do, and what your monthly expenses are. So it would be best to first examine how much money you need every month to cover your needs from mortgage or rent, to groceries, childcare, medical, or discretionary expenses.
	- Recommended saving rates
		- Even if you do enroll in a 401k but don't get around to actually setting the percentage deduction, your employer will most likely auto-deduct a default percentage from your paycheck and this is often in the range of 2%. This is a really good move in my opinion, because we will immediately start saving small amounts of money even if inertia gets the better of us and we don't get around to setting percentages in a 401k.
		- If you do get around it, and if your monthy budget permits, it is generally recommended that you save at least 10% of your paycheck in a 401k. Obviously, the more the better, but that should be a good start.
	- Continuous increase program
		- As time rolls on, you want to make sure that you increase the amount of money you save in a 401k. For this reason, many employers do provide a continuous increase program where you can set what % your 401k contribution should increase every year. A good idea here is to set it to annually increase 1-2%, so that in about 5 years you are now saving 15-20% of your paycheck and well on your way to financial freedom.
