tentative title: 4 money misconceptions that kept me poor

### Intro

A friend once asked me, "How much money do you need so that you can stop working?. The answer to that question will decide how you live your life". I laughed, and replied, "How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?" Then he said, "You're done for". I ask him why. He then said, "You will work till you die".

To not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx

I did belong to the non-saving group at one point in my life, and what held me back were the incorrect notions in my head about what saving and investing really was. Things like, I don't make enough, or I'm too young, I'll just start later. Investing itself seemed hard to me, with all its complex terminology and I thought it's a form a gambling, and a sure fire way to lose all my money. Now I know, these were misconceptions, and in this video I'm going to explain why and provide concrete steps for you to start saving today towards a secure financial future. Let's get started.

### Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save

Ronald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. So what you might ask? To that I will say,

"Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars"

To get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. 

Each person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Here's a list of things you probably dont need, to get you started on thinking along those lines.
- A new mobile phone
- All those TV subscriptions
- Even the latest TV
- A fancy car
- An expensive vacation
 - A gym membership you don't use
- Expensive clothing
- Eating at fancy restaurants

Use these savings to pay off credit card debt first. Seriously, do not have credit card debt. I'm not kidding.  After that, even if you manage to save up $100 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck. Use a budgeting software if you have to, or write on a napkin, it doesn't matter, but find a way to know where your money is going. Personally, I just use a simple google spreadsheet to estimate my expenses, while breaking them down into major categories. I'm not particularly crazy about this to the last digit but at the end of the month, I track my expenses on a tool like Mint to make sure that I am relatively on track with what I've budgeted. At 3- or 6-month intervals, I like to check how much I have spent already, and then multiply that number to estimate how much my yearly spending will be. If you have a fairly regular income in any given year, you can also estimate what your projected savings rate for that year willl be, which takes us to...

### Misconception #2: I'm too young to start retirement savings

Let's talk about another 92 year old, and he has not amassed $8 million, or $80 million. His net worth as it stands today is over $80 Billion, yes with a B. 

The 'Oracle of Omaha', Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11, and made his first million by the age of 30. In fact over 70 Billion of his wealth came after he turned 60. That is the magic of compounding, because in his sixties, he already been in the stock market for half a century. 

Let's say that you have managed to find ways in your budget to save $100 per month. If you simply put that in a savings bank account paying 2%, you will have $X dollars in 10 years. Instead if you invest that $100 in an S&P 500 index fund, we'll revisit how to invest later in this video, but just stay with me for now, whose historical rate of return has been 7%, your $100 monthly investment will grow to $X in 10 years. In 20 years, it will be $Y and in 30 years it will grow to $Z.

The takeaway from all this is that it is never too young to start investing. Rate of return on investment is largely not in our control, it varies depending on the stock market and interest rates. But the one thing we can actually control is our savings rate. The sooner you start to have a higher savings rate, the more your wealth will grow.

So how much should be saving? There is this simple rule of thirds that's easy to remember. Let's say that this loaf of bread is your monthly income. Let's say you pay a third in taxes, medicare, social security. That's money you'll never see again, at least for a while. You now have 2/3rds left. Use another third for your expenses, nourish yourself and your family, take affordable vacations, build memories instead of buying things.  And the final 1/3, you put away for another day. 

The average savings rate in the US is about 7-8%, and saving a third of your gross income means you are saving about 4 times as much as the average saver, and would put you in the top 5% of all savers in America. 

Understandably this is a hard target to reach, but even if you save 10 cents for every dollar you spend, this will make you an above average saver for whom compounding will work its magic provided you start early.

So you've decided to start putting away money for a rainy day, but how do you invest it? This brings us to our next misconception.

### Misconception #3: Investing in complicated

https://www.investopedia.com/financial-literacy-resource-center-7151950

The fundamental problem with education is that we were never taught financial literacy, and that has a ripple effect throughout the course of our lives. For me, it is something I picked up along the way as an adult mostly via internet forums. But that is changing now, with more and more states in the US mandating that personal finance courses be offered to high school students

The thing about investing that scared me off the most is all the terminology that surrounds it, and the media hype that you need to be some sort of a genius with numbers to successfully invest. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you are starting out, you only need to think of 3 places to park your money.

https://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/thumb/7/75/Prioritizing_investments.svg/1000px-Prioritizing_investments.svg.png
1.  The first place that you should be putting away money is in a savings account. You need to build cash reserve that you might need for emergencies such as medical bills, repairs, or job loss. Banks give you a relatively low rate of return for a savings account, but that's okay. It's not about maximizing your returns all the time. Sometimes you need money when you need it. I'd recommend building up about 6 months of expenses before even thinking of investing.
2. Once you have your savings in place, you should then contribute to a tax sheltered account such as a 401k and IRA. I made an in-depth video on this channel about investing in a 401k, so do check that out. I'll leave the link in the video description. Tax sheltering means that you will pay less in taxes, that means more money for you to use, so you should definitely be taking advantage of that.
3. Once you've got the savings and tax-sheltered account taken care of, you can then open up a brokerage account at Vanguard, Fidelity, or similar companies. Any extra money you manage to save can be put away in this account and invested for the future.

In 401k, IRA and brokerage accounts, the easiest way to get started is to buy a target date fund. This means that you figure out in what year you intend to retire, for example, the year you turn 65. And you buy a fund that is tailored to meet that retirement date. This all-in-one single fund purchase will meet all your needs at the most basic level, and get you out of analysis-paralysis and started in investing. Don't worry, you can always change your mind and switch into different funds later, but this is a great place to get started. The one reason why such a fund is a great choice is due to its low expense ratio - there's a term you have to learn about. It simply indicates how much it costs you to buy and hold the fund, and anything less that 0.5% is reasonably low-cost.

If you can get your savings going in just these three places, you will have a great start in your investing journey and you can always revisit this as you learn more. I can recommend three places online that have some great resources and a helpful community that really helped me in the past. The first one is the r/personalfinance subreddit- this is a great starting point, and you can browse through common questions on almost every conceivable topic. You can also be motivated by the 30 days challenges that are often posted, encouraging you to build better habits.  The next is the mr. money mustache forums and this is the go to forum if you really want to drive up your savings rate,and find ways to live frugally. There are plenty of tips and tricks on here to cut expenses in every which way, and the final one is the bogleheads forum which I would consider the place to ask "expert level" questions. The people on here are very knowledgable and experienced, not to mention very wealthy. They also have some excellent learning resources on their wiki that I regularly revisit.

Let's move on to the last misconception.

### Misconception #4: Investing is gambling

We all have a voice deep down that asks, "What if I lose all my money? Am I gambling by investing?" After all we regularly hear of financial scams, bank collapses and market crashes, and what if we are caught in the middle of it? In reality, the results of investing in any given time period is definitely uncertain. But there are two levers that we have in our control to maximize our chances of success. 

1.  asset allocation
2.  time in the market

Asset allocation is a fancy term that basically describes how your money is actually invested. You could choose to distribute your money between stocks, bonds, cash, or even real estate, and depending on how you split up your money between these options, your portfolio can be calculated to have a certain risk for the return you are getting. Usually, more risk, more reward, and this is characterized by a quantity called the "Sharpe Ratio", named after economist William Sharpe who developed it in 1966. In order to choose an asset allocation, we need the second lever - "time in the market". How long can we keep our money invested? Someone in their 20s has an investment horizon of over 40 years and has a longer time frame in which they can recover from market downturns compared to someone who is retiring in 5 years. 

Let's take the example of the US stock market from 1872 to 2022. Let's look at the returns in terms of rolling periods. A rolling period is a window of time within which the average return of the stock market is calculated. Assume that Subbu invested $100 in the year 1980. Let's say that year the market returned 5%, so the 1 year rolling return would be 5%. Lets then say that in the next 4 years, the market returned 6% -4% 9% and -1% respectively. So the average return over 5 years is 3% up to 1985. We can make the same calculation in the period 1981-1986, 1982 and 1987, and so on- which are different rolling 5 year windows. Now that we understand this, let's look at more rolling windows.

In a one year rolling window,  you can see that there are many years where you would have lost money and the variation of how much the return rate varies is high as shown by the standard deviation of 18.2%. But looking at the 5 year rolling window, you can see that the standard deviation is lower, and there are fewer periods where you would have lost money. In the 10 year rolling window, there are even few periods of loss and lower standard deviation. In the 20 year window, there are no periods where you would have lost money in the market.

The longer you stay invested, the more chances that you will not lose money investing. As a result, the younger investor can potentially own more risky assets, in expectation of a higher reward which is another reason for starting investing early. The younger you are, the more you can weather market storms. A commonly used yardstick is to have 100-your age in stocks, since it is typically a riskier asset than bonds or cash. So someone in their 20s can have 75-80% in stocks, and allocate the rest to bonds or cash. Also, be prepared to hold these stocks for decades regardless of the market ups and downs. Panic selling in market downturns will make those paper losses real, and significantly impact your return over the long run. Ask yourself, "Am I prepared to see a loss of 50% in my stock portfolio and be ready to nothing about it?". If the answer is no, dial down your exposure to stocks in your asset allocation. Pick a value that will help you sleep better at night. Hopefully this convinces you that investing does not have to be a gamble if you can buy a diversified asset and hold it for a long time. 

So there you go - I hope you found this useful. Here is quick chart showing the key takeaways from this video. If you've never started investing, I hope this video has given you a starting point.
