### Intro

**Shot**: I am walking through the corridors at work. I insert the key into my door. I plug in my laptop, and just as "work till you die" sentence comes on, I log in to my computer. Then blue screen of death appears.

> [!note] A friend once asked me, "How much money do you need so that you can stop working?. The answer to that question will decide how you live your life". I laughed, and replied, "How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?" Then he said, "You're done for". I ask him why. He then said, "You will work till you die".

**Shot**: Close up shot of my typing on keyboard and using a mouse. Close up view of my face looking at a computer monitor. Show a infographic to illustrate that 40% of US do not invest. Text showing $133 million people have not owned a single stock.

> [!note] To not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. 

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note] I know I did belong to this population at one point in my life, and what held me back were my misconceptions of what investing was. Whether you're saving and investing already or not, I hope this video will motivate you to get started, or inspire you to do better than you already are.

### Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save

**Shot**: Photo of Ronald Reed on vintage film roll background, include photo shutter sounds. Put text under the photo describing the timeline of what he did and his age at that time. It will be cool if I can make it look like its an vintage FBI dossier on the guy.
**Music**: Old time jukebox music
>[!note] Ronald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. So what you might ask? To that I will say,

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note]  "Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars"

**Shot**: Get some video shots of me shopping; place camera under costco cart, or in it. A shot of me looking at a product, its price and not buying it. Put an infographic about the numbers in this section. At the end make a splash slide showing "Cut Spending" to drive home the point.
> [!note] To get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. 

**Shot**: Film a close up of you writing your expenses on a piece of paper. Shot of you making aeropress coffee. Shot of you reading a book. Use an infographic to show a cartoon person move from the 64% bar graph to the 36% bar graph by just saving a few dollars every month. 
> [!note] Each person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Use a budgeting software if you have to, or write on a napkin, it doesn't matter. Cut out that morning starbucks if you have to, and make coffee at home. Or cancel some recurring TV subscriptions that you don't use as much, there are so many others ways you could be spending your time usefully. Even if you manage to save up  $50 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck. Everyone has to start somewhere.

### Misconception #2: I'm too young to save for retirement

> [!note] Let's talk about another 92 year old, and he has not amassed $8 million, or $80 million. His net worth as it stands today is over $80 Billion, yes with a B. The 'Oracle of Omaha', Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11, and made his first million by the age of 30. In fact over 70 Billion of his wealth came after he turned 60. That is the magic of compounding, because in his sixties, he already been in the stock market for half a century. It is no doubt that he is a gifted investor, compounding at roughly 22% annually, more than I can personally even dream of making. But this record actually goes to Jim Simons of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who has compounded money at 66% since 1988 in his Medallion fund. But even at this remarkable rate, Simons' net worth is only a quarter of Buffet's. Simons found his investment stride only in his 50s and had half the time Buffet had for compound interest to work.

> [!note] It is never too young to start investing. The return on investment is largely not in our control, it varies depending on the stock market and interest rates. But the one thing we can actually control is our savings rate. The sooner you start to have a higher savings rate, the more your wealth will grow. Rather than the vague savings rate target of "as high as possible" I like to use the rule of thirds to shoot for a meaningful target savings rate, and it goes like this. For every 1 dollar you earn, leave 1/3 for taxes, save 1/3 and spend 1/3, or put it another way, save 1 dollar for every 1 dollar of take home pay you spend.
