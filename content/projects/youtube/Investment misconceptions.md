### Intro

**Shot**: I am walking through the corridors at work. I insert the key into my door. I plug in my laptop, and just as "work till you die" sentence comes on, I log in to my computer. Then blue screen of death appears.

> [!note] A friend once asked me, "How much money do you need so that you can stop working?. The answer to that question will decide how you live your life". I laughed, and replied, "How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?" Then he said, "You're done for". I ask him why. He said, "You will work till you die".

**Shot**: Close up shot of my typing on keyboard and using a mouse. Close up view of my face looking at a computer monitor. Show a infographic to illustrate that 40% of US do not invest. Text showing $133 million people, not owned a single shot.

> [!note] To not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning stocks. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. 

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note] I know I did belong to this population at one point in my life, and what held me back were my misconceptions related to what investing was. Whether you're saving and investing already or not, I hope this video will motivate you to get started, or give you ideas to improve what you're already doing.

- This is the same regardless of income level
- A person making less can still become a millionaire, there are plenty of stories where a janitor put away a little every month and left millions when he died. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/29/janitor-secretly-amassed-an-8-million-fortune.html
- Famous athletes go broke regularly.
