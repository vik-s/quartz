### Intro

**Shot**: I am walking through the corridors at work. I insert the key into my door. I plug in my laptop, and just as "work till you die" sentence comes on, I log in to my computer. Then blue screen of death appears.

> [!note] A friend once asked me, "How much money do you need so that you can stop working?. The answer to that question will decide how you live your life". I laughed, and replied, "How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?" Then he said, "You're done for". I ask him why. He then said, "You will work till you die".

**Shot**: Close up shot of my typing on keyboard and using a mouse. Close up view of my face looking at a computer monitor. Show a infographic to illustrate that 40% of US do not invest. Text showing $133 million people have not owned a single stock.

> [!note] To not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. 

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note] I know I did belong to this population at one point in my life, and what held me back were my misconceptions of what investing was. Whether you're saving and investing already or not, I hope this video will motivate you to get started, or inspire you to do better than you already are.

==Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save==
**Shot**: Photo of Ronald Reed on vintage film roll background, include photo shutter sounds. Put text under the photo describing the timeline of what he did and his age at that time. It will be cool if I can make it look like its an vintage FBI dossier on the guy.
**Music**: Old time jukebox music
>[!note] Ronald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. If you havent already clicked away from this video, so what you might ask? To that I will say,

> [!note]  "Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars"

**Shot**: 
> [!note] To get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. 

> [!note] Each person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Cut out that morning starbucks if you have to, they're mostly too sugary, and make coffee at home. Or Cut out some recurring TV subscriptions that you don't use as much, there are so many others ways you could be spending your time usefully. Even if you manage to save up  $10-20 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck.
