tentative title: 4 money misconceptions that kept me poor

### Intro

**Shot**: I am walking through the corridors at work. I insert the key into my door. I plug in my laptop, and just as "work till you die" sentence comes on, I log in to my computer. Then blue screen of death appears.

> [!note] A friend once asked me, "How much money do you need so that you can stop working?. The answer to that question will decide how you live your life". I laughed, and replied, "How can you put a number on it, isn't more better?" Then he said, "You're done for". I ask him why. He then said, "You will work till you die".

**Shot**: Close up shot of my typing on keyboard and using a mouse. Close up view of my face looking at a computer monitor. Show a infographic to illustrate that 40% of US do not invest. Text showing $133 million people have not owned a single stock.

> [!note] To not work till we die, we need money to stop working. Money that will carry us through our sunset years. Enough so that we will not have to trade our precious time on this blue marble we live in, working for money. Investing is one way to make that money, but a recent poll found that only about 60% of people in the United States reported owning any stocks at all. That leaves 133 million people in the US alone, who have never owned a single stock. 

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note] I did belong to the non-saving group at one point in my life, and what held me back were the incorrect notions in my head about what saving and investing really was. Things like, I don't make enough, or I'm too young, I'll just start later. Investing itself seemed hard to me, and I thought I would lose all my money. Now I know, I WAS DEAD WRONG.

### Misconception #1: I don't make enough to save

**Shot**: Photo of Ronald Reed on vintage film roll background, include photo shutter sounds. Put text under the photo describing the timeline of what he did and his age at that time. It will be cool if I can make it look like its an vintage FBI dossier on the guy.
**Music**: Old time jukebox music
>[!note] Ronald Reed died on Jun 2, 2014. He was 92 years old. He was in the US military, and when he was honorably discharged in 1945, he worked as a gas station attendent for 25 years. After that he took on a part time gig as a janitor at JC Penny for the next 17 years. So what you might ask? To that I will say,

**Shot**: Talking head
> [!note]  "Oh nothing really, he just managed to amass $8 million dollars"

**Shot**: Get some video shots of me shopping; place camera under costco cart, or in it. A shot of me looking at a product, its price and not buying it. Put an infographic about the numbers in this section. At the end make a splash slide showing "Cut Spending" to drive home the point.
> [!note] To get wealthy, it's not always what you make. It's what you don't spend. Ronald Reed's success was a result of a lifetime of living frugally and being a disciplined investor. He held a basket of about 95 well diversified stocks, and held them for several decades. But on an even more basic level, what percentage of our income do we save today? According to a recent survey, 64% of the US were living paycheck to paycheck, but 48% of them were making over a hundred thousand dollars per year. That's 210million americans who have a savings rate of 0% - and seemingly income level doesn't matter. No matter how much you make, the first step is to figure out ways to cut spending. 

**Shot**: Film a close up of you writing your expenses on a piece of paper. Shot of you making aeropress coffee. Shot of you reading a book. Use an infographic to show a cartoon person move from the 64% bar graph to the 36% bar graph by just saving a few dollars every month. 
> [!note] Each person's situation is different, so look at your spending closely, and identify at least one or two things you can cut out to start with. Use a budgeting software if you have to, or write on a napkin, it doesn't matter. Cut out that morning starbucks if you have to, and make coffee at home. Or cancel some recurring TV subscriptions that you don't use as much, there are so many others ways you could be spending your time usefully. Even if you manage to save up  $50 per month, you're already part of the 36% *not* living paycheck to paycheck. Everyone has to start somewhere.

### Misconception #2: I'm too young to save for retirement

**SHOT**: Talking head
> [!note] Let's talk about another 92 year old, and he has not amassed $8 million, or $80 million. His net worth as it stands today is over $80 Billion, yes with a B. 

**SHOT**: Put a chart of the growth of warren buffett's net worth over time and indicate each part as you describe various aspects of it. Show a picture of Simons and Buffett side by side and explain the differences of each persons investment style, and net worth. Use bar graphs to show the return rates and the total net worth.
> [!note] The 'Oracle of Omaha', Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11, and made his first million by the age of 30. In fact over 70 Billion of his wealth came after he turned 60. That is the magic of compounding, because in his sixties, he already been in the stock market for half a century. It is no doubt that he is a gifted investor, with a return rate of over 20% annually, more than I can personally even dream of making. But this record actually goes to Jim Simons of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who has compounded money at the rate of 66% since 1988 in his Medallion fund. Simons used mathematical models to identify profitable trades, he is what you call a Quant on Wall Street. But Buffett focuses on buying good businesses and holding them for the long term. It is likely that Buffett's approach of holding investments for the long haul has resulted in a net worth that is 5 times that of Jim Simons.

**SHOT**: Get B-roll videos of setting up for baking bread. The whole loaf is your monthly income. Set up three plates. One for taxes, one for spending, and one for saving. Take away the taxes plate, you'll never see that money again. Cut one slice of bread from the spending plate, apply spread on it, and enjoy it. For the spending part of it, show how you can put tasty spreads on it, and even bite it in the shape of a car and make the kids drive it around. The last 1/3 you put away into a box for another day. 

> [!note] So what did we learn from all of this? It is never too young to start investing. Rate of return on investment is largely not in our control, it varies depending on the stock market and interest rates. But the one thing we can actually control is our savings rate. The sooner you start to have a higher savings rate, the more your wealth will grow.

> [!note]  So how much should be saving? There is this simple rule of thirds that's easy to remember. Let's say that this loaf of bread is your monthly income. Let's say you pay a third in taxes, medicare, social security. That's money you'll never see again, at least for a while. You now have 2/3rds left. Use another third for your expenses, nourish yourself and your family, take your vacations, and improve your skills. Try to buy experiences with your money. Memories last longer than material possessions.  And the final 1/3, you put away for another day. 

**SHOT**: Talking head
> [!note] The average savings rate in the US is about 7-8%, and saving a third of your gross income means you are saving about 4 times as much as the average saver, and would put you in the top 5% of all savers in America. 

**SHOT**: Video of putting away a single slice of bread into the box.
> [!note] Understandably this is a hard target to reach, but even if you save 10 cents for every dollar you spend, this will make you an above average saver for whom compounding will work its magic provided you start early.

**SHOT**: Talking head
> [!note] So you've decided to start putting away money for a rainy day, but how do you invest it? This brings us to our next misconception.

### Misconception #3: Investing in complicated

https://www.investopedia.com/financial-literacy-resource-center-7151950

**SHOT**: Record this as a talking head shot and see if you can put a screenshot of browsing investopedia for financial literacy, and then landing on the map showing the requirements by state for financial literacy.
>[!note] The fundamental problem with education is that we were never taught financial literacy, and that has a ripple effect throughout the course of our lives. For me, it is something I picked up along the way as an adult mostly via internet forums. But that is changing now, with more and more states in the US mandating that personal finance courses be offered to high school students

**SHOT**: Talking head
>[!note] The thing about investing that scared me off the most is all the terminology that surrounds it, and the media hype that you need to be some sort of a genius with numbers to successfully invest. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you are starting out, you only need to think of 3 places to park your money.
https://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/thumb/7/75/Prioritizing_investments.svg/1000px-Prioritizing_investments.svg.png
1.  The first place that you should be putting away money is in a savings account. You need to build cash reserve that you might need for emergencies such as medical bills, repairs, or job loss. Banks give you a relatively low rate of return for a savings account, but that's okay. It's not about maximizing your returns all the time. Sometimes you need money when you need it. I'd recommend building up about 6 months of expenses before even thinking of investing.
2. Once you have your savings in place, you should then contribute to a tax sheltered account such as a 401k. Here is a video where I go in depth about investing in a 401k, so do check that out. I'll have a link in the video description too. Tax sheltering means that you will pay less in taxes, that means more money for you to use, so you should definitely be taking advantage of that.
3. Once you've got the savings and tax-sheltered account taken care of, you can then open up a brokerage account at Vanguard, Fidelity, or similar companies. Any extra money you manage to save can be put away in this account and invested for the future.

In 401k, IRA and brokerage accounts, the easiest way to get started is to buy a target date fund. This means that you figure out in what year you intend to retire, for example, the year you turn 65. And you buy a fund that is tailored to meet that retirement date. This all-in-one single fund purchase will meet all your needs at the most basic level, and get you out of analysis-paralysis and started in investing. Don't worry, you can always change your mind and switch into different funds later, but this is a great place to get started. The one reason why such a fund is a great choice is due to its low expense ratio - there's a term you have to learn about. It simply indicates how much it costs you to buy and hold the fund, and anything less that 0.5% is reasonably low-cost.

If you can get your savings going in just these three places, you will have a great start in your investing journey and you can always revisit this as you learn more. I can recommend three places online that have some great resources and a helpful community that really helped me in the past. The first one is the r/personalfinance subreddit- this is a great starting point, and you can browse through common questions on almost every conceivable topic. You can also be motivated by the 30 days challenges that are often posted, encouraging you to build better habits.  The next is the mr. money mustache forums and this is the go to forum if you really want to drive up your savings rate,and find ways to live frugally. There are plenty of tips and tricks on here to cut expenses in every which way, and the final one is the bogleheads forum which I would consider the place to ask "expert level" questions. The people on here are very knowledgable and experienced, not to mention very wealthy. They also have some excellent learning resources on their wiki that I regularly revisit.

Let's move on to the last misconception.

### Misconception #4: Investing is gambling

We all have a voice deep down that asks, "What if I lose all my money? Am I gambling by investing?" After all we regularly hear of financial scams, bank collapses and market crashes, and what if we are caught in the middle of it? In reality, the results of investing in any given time period is definitely uncertain. But there are two levers that we have in our control to maximize our chances of success. 

1.  asset allocation
2.  time in the market

Asset allocation is a fancy term that basically describes how your money is actually invested. You could choose to distribute your money between stocks, bonds, cash, or even real estate, and depending on how you split up your money between these options, your portfolio can be calculated to have a certain risk for the return you are getting. Usually, more risk, more reward, and this is characterized by a quantity called the "Sharpe Ratio", named after economist William Sharpe who developed it in 1966. In order to choose an asset allocation, we need the second lever - "time in the market". How long can we keep our money invested? Someone in their 20s has an investment horizon of over 40 years and has a longer time frame in which they can recover from market downturns compared to someone who is retiring in 5 years. 

Let's take the example of the US stock market from 1872 to 2022. Let's look at the returns in terms of rolling periods. A rolling period is a window of time within which the average return of the stock market is calculated. Assume that Subbu invested $100 in the year 1980. Let's say that year the market returned 5%, so the 1 year rolling return would be 5%. Lets then say that in the next 4 years, the market returned 6% -4% 9% and -1% respectively. So the average return over 5 years is 3% up to 1985. We can make the same calculation in the period 1981-1986, 1982 and 1987, and so on- which are different rolling 5 year windows. Now that we understand this, let's look at some real data.

As a result, the younger investor can potentially own more risky assets, in expectation of a higher reward (another reason for starting investing early.) A commonly used yardstick is to have 100-your age in stocks, since it is typically a riskier asset than bonds or cash. So someone in their 20s can have 75-80% in stocks, and allocate the rest to bonds or cash. Also, be prepared to hold these stocks for decades regardless of the market ups and downs. Panic selling in market downturns will make those paper losses real, and significantly impact your return over the long run. Ask yourself, "Am I prepared to see a loss of 50% in my stock portfolio and be ready to nothing about it?". If the answer is no, dial down your exposure to stocks in your asset allocation. Pick a value that will help you sleep better at night.
