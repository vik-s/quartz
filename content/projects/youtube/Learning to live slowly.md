## The Idea Phase

### ðŸ’¡What is the video about?
This video is about how I found that periodically slowing down my daily life increased my peace of mind and focus.

### âœ… What are some key takeaways?
Everybody should find ways to live intentionally slow every now and then. They can do it by going out in nature on walks, hikes, or spending a few days camping. If nothing else, sit and stare into the sky and pay attention to every sensation around you. Or even the smallest chores, hear the clinks when you make tea. Be mindful and present.

## Script (1000 words / 5 mins)

### Introduction
Over the last few months, my life got pretty busy. I had an overflowing list of things to do, projects to finish, and deadlines to meet. I am a hardware engineer working on making communication devices, and while I do love what I do, it gets hard to balance that with my family time and personal time. Work always takes up a disproportiate part of my day, leaving me wanting more time to spend with loved ones and things I am passionate about.

I tried productivity techniques to streamline my day - things like time-blocking and pomodoro, and while they do help me to some extent, I dont find myself doing it all the time. There is a burn out that comes with trying to maximize every living moment.

Instead, I tried something completely counter intuitive. Slowing down.

In this video, I'll describe how I intentionally try to slow down, and how it has helped me become more productive while being less stressed about my day to day life. (write a bit more here)

### Main Content

##### Intention and Mindfulness
The first thing I experimented with is - being intentional with silence. Often the temptation is to listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks while doing work - whether it is knowledge work or just chores at home. I found that this was filling up what Chris Bailey calls "Attentional Space" in his book "Hyperfocus". Your attentional space is what you can pay at most attention to, at any given time. Whatever you are working on, let's say takes up 80% of your attentional space, the temptation is to fill the remaining 20% with something like music. What I have found is that leaving the 20% unfilled results in a lot less mental fatigue when you have some wiggle room in your attentional space. It's rather unsurprising that it is exhausting to run my mental CPU cores at maximum capacity all the time. By running my mental cores at moderate capacity helps me work for longer periods of time with greater focus, and I'm less tired at the end.

It's not like I never listen to a podcast when I am working on something. I do. But I try to make sure that what I am doing occupies relatively little attentional space. Habitual things like folding laundry, doing dishes or vacuuming usually takes little focus from the mind. At these times, I have plenty of attentional space to listen to a podcast or audiobook, and I do so if I feel like it.

When I started leaving some attentional space free and not filling it with a distraction, something interesting happened. I started to notice a lot more - the mouse clicks while I'm working, the sound of water when I'm cleaning, sounds of food cooking. It was a natural symphony that would otherwise be blocked out by the audiobook I'm listening to. It had a naturally soothing effect on my mind. I think the right word for this is mindfulness. Being mindful about what I'm doing had a way of stopping me from trying to get things done as fast as I could. I started to let things take the time they need. I was doing things I needed to get done, but without the accompanying stress.

By slowing down and doing one thing at a time, I will not listen to all the podcasts or audiobooks that I wanted to. And that's fine. I figured that I don't have to rush to consume all the content that is out there. This helped me be more picky about what I will actually listen to, and that's a good thing. Intentional silence goes a long way in making a peaceful mind.

##### Reframing expectations
My second major mindshift came when I asked my older child a question: "The floor is full of markers, paper and toys. Does it not bother you?" Then I proceeded to say - "It bothers me because the floor is where I walk, and now I'm not able to very well". His answer was - " I don't have a big enough table to work on, so this floor space is my workspace."
