## The Idea Phase

### ðŸ’¡What is the video about?
This video is about how I found that periodically slowing down my daily life increased my peace of mind and focus.

### âœ… What are some key takeaways?
Everybody should find ways to live intentionally slow every now and then. They can do it by going out in nature on walks, hikes, or spending a few days camping. If nothing else, sit and stare into the sky and pay attention to every sensation around you. Or even the smallest chores, hear the clinks when you make tea. Be mindful and present.

### ðŸ‘¾ What are some title ideas?
- How slowing down increased my focus and creativity

### ðŸŽ‡ List out some thumbnail ideas
- A picture of me closing my eyes, and text showing all the good things around my head
- Half happy face with word SLOW and half sad face with word FAST
- Me sitting in a relaxed pose with words "100x PRODUCTIVE"

## Script (1000 words / 5 mins)

### Introduction
Over the last few months, my life got pretty busy. I had an overflowing list of things to do, projects to finish, and deadlines to meet. I am a hardware engineer working on making communication devices, and while I do love what I do, it gets hard to balance that with my family time and personal time. Work always takes up a disproportiate part of my day, leaving me wanting more time to spend with loved ones and things I am passionate about.

I tried productivity techniques to streamline my day - things like time-blocking and pomodoro, and while they do help me to some extent, I dont find myself doing it all the time. There is a burn out that comes with trying to maximize every living moment.

Instead, I tried something completely counter intuitive. Slowing down.

In this video, I'll describe how I intentionally try to slow down, and how it has helped me become more productive while being less stressed about my day to day life. (write a bit more here)

### Main Content
The first thing I experimented is -being intentional with silence. Often the temptation is to listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks while doing work - whether it is knowledge work or just chores at home. I found that this was filling up what Chris Bailey calls "Attentional Space" in his book "Hyperfocus". Your attentional space is what you can pay at most attention to, at any given time. Whatever you are working on, let's say takes up 80% of your attentional space, the temptation is to fill the remaining 20% with a distraction. What I have found is that leaving the 20% unfilled results in a lot less mental fatigue when you have some wiggle room in your attentional space. It's rather unsurprising that it is exhausting to run my mental CPU cores at maximum capacity all the time. By running my mental cores at moderate capacity leaves me able to work for longer periods of time with greater focus.

It's not like I never listen to a podcast when I am working on something. I do. But I try to make sure that what I am doing occupies relatively little attentional space. Habitual things like folding laundry, doing dishes or vacuuming usually takes little focus from the mind. At these times, I have plenty of attentional space to listen to a podcast or audiobook.

The next natural consequence of silence is - to hear the sounds around you. There is a reason that ASMR videos are so popular on youtube - they have a calming effect on the mind.
