## The Idea Phase

### ðŸ’¡What is the video about?
This video is about how I found that periodically slowing down my daily life increased my peace of mind and focus.

### âœ… What are some key takeaways?
Everybody should find ways to live intentionally slow every now and then. They can do it by going out in nature on walks, hikes, or spending a few days camping. If nothing else, sit and stare into the sky and pay attention to every sensation around you. Or even the smallest chores, hear the clinks when you make tea. Be mindful and present.

### ðŸ‘¾ What are some title ideas?
- How slowing down increased my focus and creativity (without meditation)

### ðŸŽ‡ List out some thumbnail ideas
