Hey there everybody, in this episode we will talk about different ways to spend our time effectively, so that we can be aware of where we are spending it, and where we are falling short. In essence, we are setting up a time budget, and making sure we are spending it wisely on things we actually care about. So let's dive right in.

There are fundamentally X categories that we can classify our time into:
- Time bartered for money
- Time spent in leisure
- Time spent in chores
- Time spent in commute
- Time in community
