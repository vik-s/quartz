Reasons to pay for services.
- you cant youtube everything, some things need an expert to get done
- it may be beyond your current physical ability
- 
- Housecleaning
	- Good vacuum cleaner - like dyson, vac+mop, or robovac
	- House cleaning services $30-50/hr
- Yardwork
	- Mowing lawn, trimming outgrowth
	- Pool cleaning
	- Plow the driveway
	- cost?
- Home repairs
	- Get a handyman to make repairs that would take anywhere upwards or a few hours
	- Get a painter
- Taxes
	- Get an accountant
- Commute
	- Minimize your work commute, you might need to spend more to live closer, but to keep costs in check, you might sacrifice on the overall space you have
	- The exception to this is if you have access to good public transportation. In that case, you can both commute and have time to read/work etc. Have the cake and eat it too.
- Cooking
	- Eat out - more expensive but you have no overhead, but health is an issue.
	- Have healthy meals that are easy to prepare and create minimal overhead
	- Prep food all in one go- reuse pots and pans, and cook while the oven is hot.
	- Make it a family affair to bond over
- Home exercise equipment
	- Going to a gym introduces more inertia, has a monthly cost, and requires time to drive back and forth.
	- Setting up a home gym can be a high one time cost, but it pays back long term, minimizes inertia
	- Buying a set of adjustable dumbells is a compact solution
	- There are plenty of exercises that can be done in a small space
	- Personal trainer
- Shop almost entirely online
- Car care
	- Get oil changes and tire rotations done
- Childcare
	- Nanny / baby sitter so that you can work on your relationship or relax.
	- Not a big fan of recommending this, but on occasion it is required.
