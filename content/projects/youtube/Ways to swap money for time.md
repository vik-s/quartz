We've all been there. Those times when we have more things to do than time allows, leading us to feel overwhelmed and stressed out. Time is a continuously depleted resource. We cant store it, we can't compound it. It is a use it or lose it kind of deal.

Money compounds when invested properly. You can make more money by investing the time you have into developing your skills, or taking on more responsibility at work. You can use your time to relax, exercise or spend meaningful time with the people you care about - your friends and family.  When you spend time doing everything yourself, you also spend energy, and you need to spend more time to recover that energy. Precious time that you cannot spend on doing the things you want to do.

In this video, we'll talk about 10 ways in which you can buy back your time with money, and here are some reasons apart from the time thing, why you should consider doing so.
- you cant youtube everything, some things need an expert to get done properly
- it may be beyond your current physical ability
- you just don't enjoy doing it
- you may risk hurting yourself

- Housecleaning
	- There are two options here:
		- Get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a EuFY or Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won't weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. However this is just the floors, you will still have to do the kitchen countertops and bathrooms yourself.
		- Get House cleaning services. These typically run $20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. A house cleaner coming in will typically do a good job, and will be able to clean more than just floors, like countertops and bathrooms. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty (it can, if you have kids or pets), and how much you want to spend on the service. You can even get just deep cleanings done once a quarter, where things like blinds and fans get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about $200-$500 depending on the size of your house.
- Home maintenance
	- Mowing lawn, trimming outgrowth
	- Pool cleaning
	- Plow the driveway
	- Tree removal
	- Get a handyman to make repairs that would take anywhere upwards or a few hours
	- Plumbing, electrical, fences, window cleaning, pressure washing, strip and restain wood floors, roofing, remodel, HVAC, gutter cleaning,
- Cooking
	- Eat out - more expensive but you have no overhead, but health is an issue.
	- Meal delivery services
	- Pre-made meal kits - Have healthy meals that are easy to prepare and create minimal overhead
	- Prep food all in one go- reuse pots and pans, and cook while the oven is hot.
	- Get some one to cut stuff and clean up after?
	- Make it a family affair to bond over
- Laundry Service
	- If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for.
	- how it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.
	- The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you. 
- Online Shopping
-  Commute
	- If you have the option for remote work, this might not apply but many people still commute to their at least a few times a week.
	- Minimize your work commute, you might need to spend more to live closer, but to keep costs in check, you might sacrifice on the overall space you have
	- The exception to this is if you have access to good public transportation. In that case, you can both commute and have time to read/work etc. Have the cake and eat it too.
- Car care
	- Get oil changes and tire rotations done
- Home exercise equipment
	- Going to a gym introduces more inertia, has a monthly cost, and requires time to drive back and forth.
	- Setting up a home gym can be a high one time cost, but it pays back long term, minimizes inertia
	- Buying a set of adjustable dumbells is a compact solution
	- There are plenty of exercises that can be done in a small space
	- Personal trainer
- Virtual Assistant
	- If you have a lot of administrative tasks to do, consider hiring a virtual assistant. They can help you with tasks like scheduling appointments, responding to emails, and managing your calendar.
- Child care
	- Nanny
	- Baby sitter
	- Mothers helper
