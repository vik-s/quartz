Money compounds when invested properly but time is a continuously depleted resource. We cant store it, we can't compound it. It's use it or lose it. What if you can spend money to protect your time? Instead, use your time to learn something new, exercise, build relationships, relax - the possibilites are endless. 

In this video, we'll talk about 10 ways in which you can buy back your time with money. Apart from time, here are 4 more reasons why you should not do everything yourself.
- you cant youtube everything, some things need an expert to get done properly
- it may be beyond your current physical ability
- you just don't enjoy doing it
- you may risk hurting yourself

With this in mind, let's get started.

- Housecleaning
	- There are two options here:
		- Get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a EuFY or Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won't weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. However this is just the floors, you will still have to do the kitchen countertops and bathrooms yourself.
		- Get House cleaning services. These typically run $20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. A house cleaner coming in will typically do a good job, and will be able to clean more than just floors, like countertops and bathrooms. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty (it can, if you have kids or pets), and how much you want to spend on the service. You can even get just deep cleanings done once a quarter, where things like blinds and fans get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about $200-$500 depending on the size of your house.
		- When you spend time doing everything yourself, you also spend energy, and you need to spend more time to recover that energy. Precious time that you cannot spend on doing the things you want to do.

- Laundry Service
	- If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for.
	- how it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.
	- The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you. 
	- **B-ROLL**
		- Carrying laundry basket
		- Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials
		- Folding clothes, putting on hangars
- Online Shopping
-  Commute
	- If you have the option for remote work, this might not apply but many people still commute to their at least a few times a week.
	- Minimize your work commute, you might need to spend more to live closer, but to keep costs in check, you might sacrifice on the overall space you have
	- The exception to this is if you have access to good public transportation. In that case, you can both commute and have time to read/work etc. Have the cake and eat it too.

- Home exercise equipment
	- Going to a gym introduces more inertia, has a monthly cost, and requires time to drive back and forth.
	- Setting up a home gym can be a high one time cost, but it pays back long term, minimizes inertia
	- Buying a set of adjustable dumbells is a compact solution
	- There are plenty of exercises that can be done in a small space
	- Personal trainer
