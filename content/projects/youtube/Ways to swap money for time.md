Money compounds when invested properly but time is a continuously depleted resource. We cant store it, we can't compound it. It's use it or lose it. What if you can spend money to protect your time? Instead, use your time to learn something new, exercise, build relationships, relax - the possibilites are endless. Apart from time, there are more reasons why you should not do everything yourself.
- some things need an expert to get done properly
- it may be beyond your current physical ability
- you just don't enjoy doing it
- you may risk hurting yourself

In this video, we'll talk about 10 ways in which you can buy back your time with money. 

- Housecleaning
	- For the longest time, I was resisting getting help on this one and did everything myself. I told myself that I am not that busy or that entitled to clean up after myself, then I convinced myself that no cleaner can match my OCD-infused levels of ultra-cleanliness that I expect when I pay hard earned money to someone.
	- As it turns out none of this is true. I finally came around to admitting that I needed the help given that we have children and two full time jobs, and that cleaners are super professional at what they do and generally do a good job. Additionally, not only do i not spend the time cleaning, I don't spend time recovering energy from my cleaning work. This was a double win for me.
	- House cleaning services typically run $20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. You can get quotes from cleaning companies in your area. If you've never got your housed professionally cleaned before, they might insist that you get a deep cleaning first -  which can run you about $300-$400. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty and how much you want to spend on the service. Or, you can even get just deep cleanings done once in a few months, where things like blinds, fans and refridgerators get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about $200-$500 depending on the size of your house.
	- This might be too expensive for some people, that's totally understandable. In that case, get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a EuFY or Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won't weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. However this is just the floors, you will still have to do the kitchen countertops and bathrooms yourself.

- Home maintenance
	- If you own a home,  you already know there is a long list of pending projects you've been meaning to get to. It might make sense for you to outsource your routine maintenance work so that you can get to the projects that have a higher impact on your home.
	- Mowing lawn, trimming outgrowth
	- Pool cleaning
	- Plow the driveway
	- Tree removal
	- Get a handyman to make repairs that would take anywhere upwards or a few hours
	- Plumbing, electrical, fences, window cleaning, pressure washing, strip and restain wood floors, rooing, remodel, HVAC, gutter cleaning,

- Cooking
	- We need to eat everyday, and what we eat matters to our health. Eating out, while making the healthiest food choices can definitely save you time, but good quality food, even if readily available around you, can be very expensive over the long term. I do have friends who argue that the overhead of buying groceries, preparing food, dealing with the ensuing kitchen clean up, etc, is simply not for them, and the expense of eating out is totally worth it.
	- An alternative to eating out all the time is to have pre-prepared meal kits delivered at your doorstep, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to prepare your meals. There are companies such as Hello Fresh, or Fresh n Lean that ship to your door step, and you get a variety of diet choices like vegan, paleo, keto. The cost per serving is typically between $10-$20, and while this calculus might work out for some people, it is simply not an option for those with larger families.

- Laundry Service
	- If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for.
	- how it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.
	- The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you. 
	- **B-ROLL**
		- Carrying laundry basket
		- Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials
		- Folding clothes, putting on hangars
- Online Shopping
-  Commute
	- If you have the option for remote work, this might not apply but many people still commute to their at least a few times a week.
	- Minimize your work commute, you might need to spend more to live closer, but to keep costs in check, you might sacrifice on the overall space you have
	- The exception to this is if you have access to good public transportation. In that case, you can both commute and have time to read/work etc. Have the cake and eat it too.

	- Going to a gym introduces more inertia, has a monthly cost, and requires time to drive back and forth.
	- Setting up a home gym can be a high one time cost, but it pays back long term, minimizes inertia

	- There are plenty of exercises that can be done in a small space
