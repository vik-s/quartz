Choice of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver has trade-offs: 👇🏼

High IF:
- Image filtering is easy due to sufficient filter rejection
- Channel selection is difficult due to poor selectivity at high IF

Low IF:
- Image filtering is hard due to difficulty filtering a close-in image signal
- Channel selection is easy before filters are more selective at lower IF

No free lunch. Pros and cons. Decide wisely.
