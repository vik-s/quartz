He was silicon valley's first entrepreneur and also the worst engineering manager ever. These famous people worked for him:

1) Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (Intel)
2) Walter Brattain and John Bardeen (Nobel prize)
3) Jean Hoerni (inventor of planar process)
4) Jay Last (significant contributions to silicon integrated circuits)
5) Eugene Kleiner (founder of one of the first silicon valley VC firms)

He is William Shockley.

When Brattain and Bardeen invented the point contact transistor, Shockley was furious that the people who worked under him had outsmarted him. So he locked himself in a Chicago hotel room for days, and did not come out till he invented the junction transistor.

He decided to commercialize the technology and founded Shockley Semiconductor in 1955 where he insisted that he was going to build silicon transistors (Germanium valley doesn't have the same ring to it.)

He pulled together a team considered to be the greatest collection of electronics geniuses ever assembled, which is pretty much everyone on the list above (except Bardeen and Brattain).

His managing style drove away everybody and the company went under in little over a year. Shockley wanted to do something called the Shockley diode which had no market whatsoever.

The people who left went on to found Fairchild Semiconductor, and came to be called the "traitorous eight."

Moore and Noyce then left Fairchild to found Intel.

The drama between Brattain, Bardeen and Shockley runs deeper than I can write in a post. The picture of Shockley using lab equipment while Bardeen and Brattain look over remains to this day. It was the first and last time he ever touched the equipment.

Fairchild Semiconductor, a pivotal company in the history of Silicon Valley and the semiconductor industry, was founded by a group known as the "traitorous eight." These individuals were key figures who left Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory due to dissatisfaction with management and founded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. The founders were:

1. **Robert Noyce**: A physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit, Noyce later co-founded Intel Corporation.
    
2. **Gordon Moore**: A chemist and physicist, Moore is famous for Moore's Law and also co-founded Intel with Noyce.
    
3. **Julius Blank**: He played a significant role in the manufacturing processes at Fairchild and later in other technology ventures.
    
4. **Jean Hoerni**: A physicist, Hoerni invented the planar process, which was crucial in the development of modern semiconductor devices.
    
5. **Eugene Kleiner**: A physicist, Kleiner later became a venture capitalist, co-founding Kleiner Perkins, one of the first venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.
    
6. **Victor Grinich**: He was an expert in manufacturing and later became involved in academia.
    
7. **Jay Last**: A physicist, Last was instrumental in the development of silicon integrated circuits.
    
8. **Sheldon Roberts**: A metallurgist, Roberts contributed to the development of silicon semiconductor materials.
    

These individuals not only played a crucial role in the development of Fairchild Semiconductor but also in shaping the future of Silicon Valley. Many of them went on to found or contribute to other significant technology companies and ventures, further cementing their legacy in the tech industry.

## Rewrite April 14 2024

Have you heard of the world's worst manager? üëáüèº

William Shockley - inventor of the junction transistor, winner of the 1956 Nobel prize.

Why so terrible?
- Worked on secret projects without telling his team.
- Blocked his colleagues from working on his secret stuff.
- Vied for credit and failed to give recognition, thus angering his team.
- When excluded from patents, considered rewriting them solely under his name.

His team eventually left him and came to be called the traitorous eight.

Here is what they went on to do:
1. **Robert Noyce**: co-founded Intel Corporation.
2. **Gordon Moore**: co-founded Intel with Noyce.
3. **Julius Blank**: significant role in the manufacturing processes at Fairchild
4. **Jean Hoerni**: invented the planar semiconductor process
5. **Eugene Kleiner**: co-founded Kleiner Perkins, one of the first VC firms in Silicon Valley.
6. **Victor Grinich**: expert in manufacturing, later became an academic.
7. **Jay Last**: instrumental in the development of silicon integrated circuits.
8. **Sheldon Roberts**: Contributed to the development of semiconductor materials.

Treat your team well.
