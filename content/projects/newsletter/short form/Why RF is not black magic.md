I hear this everyday: RF engineering is black magic. It is not and you can do it too. 👇🏼

It used to be, before the advent of modern computer tools. RF had to be taught and learned through complex equations, trial and error.

Those who did it well seemed supernatural.

Things are different today.

You can learn the "magic" too:

Understand electromagnetic fields. 
↳ Learn Maxwell's equations intuitively with the help of EM simulators.
2. Learn your EDA software. They are tools that will let you explore complex engineering.
3. You need to DO to learn, like anything else. Books can only take you so far.
4. You can ASK people who are ahead of you. 90%+ are happy to help.

What advice do you have for people who find RF engineering hard to comprehend?
