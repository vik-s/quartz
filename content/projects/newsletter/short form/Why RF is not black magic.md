A common misconception about RF engineering is that it is black magic. 

That it is some special skill only a few people can acquire through some unknown means.

Before the advent of modern computational tools, RF had to be taught and learned through complex equations, trial and error.

Not anymore.

Here is what you need to know:

1. Electromagnetic fields. Don't be scared off by Maxwell's equations. Intuitively learn it using modern electromagnetic simulators.
2. Learn your EDA software. They are tools that will let you explore complex engineering.
3. Everything affects everything else. Explore how your circuit is affected by changing ONLY one thing at a time.
4. You need to DO to learn, like anything else. Books can only take you so far.
5. You can ASK people who are ahead of you. 90%+ are happy to help.

What advice do you have for people who find RF engineering hard to comprehend?
