Engineers don't play the long game in their careers. 👇🏼

Instead they end up:
- Chasing promotions without joy
- Prioritizing ego over relationships
- Being laser focused on compensation
- Relentlessly trying to impress supervisors
- Focusing on short term projects not long term ideas

I've also seen too many opportunities for growth turn into arguments, all for the sake of being right in the moment.

It requires a change in perspective:
- Professional life is a tribe of your peers
- Who all share a passion for engineering
- When the company wins, everyone wins
- Not everything is about right or wrong
- Mutual respect regardless of work title

Working with each other requires maturity to face our limits of knowledge and humility to accept lack thereof.

Every week, I try to fill in gaps of my own understanding in RF engineering.
