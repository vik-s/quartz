What kind of antenna is good as an array element and why? 👇🏼

Dipole Antennas: 
↳ Small size, simple structure, well suited for high density arrays.

Patch Antennas: 
↳ Popular for phased arrays due to planarity and easy integration with active electronics.
    
Slot Antennas: 
↳ Good for conformal arrays on exterior of existing surfaces.

Horn Antennas: 
↳ Wide operating bandwidth, feed parabolic dishes. Can calibrate other arrays.
    
Yagi-Uda Antennas: 
↳ Good control over radiation pattern, high directivity. Physically large.

Log-Periodic Antennas: 
↳ For broad frequency coverage. Often used in spectrum monitoring.
