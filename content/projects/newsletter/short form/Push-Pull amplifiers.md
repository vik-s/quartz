Class B amps gives great efficiency, good power, but there's a flaw.

It's something we can't look away from.

Linearity.

Amplifying half the sinusoid just doesn't cut it.

The output signal looks nothing like the input. It's distorted.

The solution? - A push-pull amplifier.

Here's the idea: 
Smash together two Class B amplifiers such that one amplifies the positive signal cycles, and the other the negatives. Use only one at a time.

Problem solved. You reconstruct the original sinusoid, but now amplified.

But what's the downside? Let me know in the comments.
