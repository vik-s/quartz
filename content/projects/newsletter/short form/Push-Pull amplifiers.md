Class B amps gives great efficiency, good power, but there's a flaw. 👇🏽

It's something we can't look away from.

Linearity.

Amplifying half the sinusoid just doesn't cut it.

The output signal looks nothing like the input. It's distorted.

The solution? - A push-pull amplifier.

Here's the idea: 
Smash together two Class B amplifiers such that one amplifies the positive signal cycles, and the other the negatives. Put them back together at the output.

Problem solved. 

You reconstruct the original sinusoid, but now amplified. And the amp has killer wide bandwidth.

But this is hard to implement at RF. Why?
