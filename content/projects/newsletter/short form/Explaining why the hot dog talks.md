This guy made a hot dog talk. Here's my explanation on why: 👇🏼

First, here's what happened in the video
- A high power AM signal is sent through the hot dog
- The hot dog melted away but you could hear the radio station

What happened here?

- The RF signal that went through the hot dog acted like a detector
	- It could not move fast as the carrier signal 
	- It vibrated according to the variation of the AM envelope
	- The hot dog essentially demodulated the AM signal
- The resulting demodulated signal vibrated the air around it
- This caused the hot dog to start talking
- The 6kW AM signal created enough heat to melt it

Fascinating but don't touch anything to an AM tower. 

Hot dog or not.

That's not what ham radio means.
