Which of these modes do you operate in, when you do engineering work? 👇🏼

Cal Newport's "Deep Work" is one of my favorite books on getting most out of my work hours. 

He describes 4 modes of operation:

👉 Monastic ‣ Work with a single point of focus, well-suited to people whose goal is to do one thing and one thing only. 

Example: Sci-fi author Neal Stephanson writing novels

👉 Bimodal ‣ Work deeply for a fixed but long stretch of time typically weeks to months. Then dedicate time to other tasks.

Example: Professor and author Adam Grant did teaching in fall and research in summer/spring.

👉 Rhythmic ‣ Work deeply at specific hours in the day, and use other hours for shallow work like meetings.

Example: Most corporate workers

👉 Journalistic ‣ Slip into deep work anytime you get a chance to do so, even for short time periods.

Example: Biographer Walter Isaacson often left parties to quickly write for even 15 mins.

I often operate in a combination of Rhythmic and Journalistic modes.
