Stripline vs. Microstrip for a transmission line. What are the differences? 👇🏼

Stripline:
🔹 Signal between two ground planes
🔹 Purely transverse electromagnetic modes (TEM)
🔹 Less coupling to other striplines and lesser stray radiation
🔹 Wider bandwidth of operation
🔹 Harder to manufacture and integrate with components

Microstrip:
🔹 One ground plane below signal, dielectric on top
🔹 Quasi TEM operation
🔹 More coupling to other microstrip, more radiation
🔹 Lower bandwidth of operation
🔹 Easier to manufacture and great to integrate with components 

While striplines are generally the "better" transmission line medium, microstrip has mostly won out due to the ease of use.
