Do you know the difference between Aperture vs Impedance Tuning using Antenna Tuners? 👇🏼

Antenna tuners are implemented with Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) single-pole multi-throw switches, with passive components in each throw depending on the tuning needed.

Aperture tuning: 
↳ The natural resonance of the antenna is shifted to the required band of operation, increasing its overall efficiency.
↳ The tuner is added at a specific location along the antenna to tune its resonance.

Impedance tuning: 
↳ Optimizes the signal transmission to the antenna by providing the correct impedance environment between the antenna and the rest of the system.
↳ The tuner is added at the antenna feed point to tune its impedance.

Today, antenna tuning is a sophisticated process with algorithms looking to dynamically improve SNR at all times. 

Fascinating.
