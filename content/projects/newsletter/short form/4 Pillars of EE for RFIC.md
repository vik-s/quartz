If you want to do RFIC design, here are four areas you should learn well.

1. Analog Circuits: Learn basic amplifiers, current mirrors, bandgaps, etc. They are used to bias any RFIC, and its best you understand it well.
2. Microwave Engineering: S-parameters, matching, smith charts, EM simulation, gain/noise/stability analysis will be your bread and butter. Learn to apply these tools effectively.
3. Semiconductor Devices: MOSFETs and BJTs are fundamental to making many amplifying, mixing and signal generation circuits. Know how they fundamentally operate.
4. RF Systems: Any circuit you design goes into a system. Understand gain, linearity and noise tradeoffs and how the pieces eventually fit together.

Don't stop here. Anything more you learn will always make you a better engineer.
