If you want to do RFIC design, here are four areas you should learn well.

1. Analog Circuits: Learn basic amplifiers, current mirrors, bandgaps, etc. They are used to bias any RFIC, and its best you understand it well.
2. Microwave Engineering: S-parameters, matching, smith charts, EM simulation, gain/noise/stability analysis will be your bread and butter. Learn to apply these tools effectively.
3. Semiconductor Devices: MOSFETs and BJTs are fundamental to making many amplifying, mixing and signal generation circuits. Know how they fundamentally operate.
4. RF Systems: Any circuit you design goes into a system. Understand gain, linearity and noise tradeoffs and how the pieces eventually fit together.

Don't stop here. Anything more you learn will always make you a better engineer.

RFIC Design 101

Over the past 13 years I have worked with colleagues from all backgrounds in several companies.

These 4 subject areas are what every one of them were good at.

Area #1: Analog Circuits
- Building blocks: op-amps, bandgaps, current mirrors
- Good PVT-independent bias generation
- Stats simulations (corners/monte-carlo)

Area #2: Microwave engineering
- S-parameters, matching, smith charts
- Gain, noise, stability, linearity.
- Wave propagation and electromagnetics

Area #3: Semiconductor devices
- MOS devices
- Bipolar transistors
- III-V technology (GaAs/GaN)

Area #4: RF systems
- System architectures
- Modulation schemes
- Wireless standards

You can specialize in any one, but having a working knowledge in all these areas will help you stand out.
