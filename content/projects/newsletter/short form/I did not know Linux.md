Nobody told me to learn this before I started working in RFIC: 👇🏼

Linux.

I had used it a little before. 

When I saw professionals use Linux the command line like ninjas... 🥷

I was just floored. 😱

I had never heard of ViM either. Look it up if you haven't.

Absolute witchcraft.

So what can you do if you haven't worked with any linux.

↳ Dual boot your Windows machine with Ubuntu
↳ Or use command line on mac; its unix (like Linux)
↳ Learn basic commands to navigate (cd, mkdir, ls, cp, rm)
↳ Understand the concept of an RC init file
↳ Learn to use tab completion (don't type everything)
↳ Learn to edit files on Linux (ViM, Gedit, Emacs)

It is hard in the beginning. But stick to it.

You'll thank yourself later.
