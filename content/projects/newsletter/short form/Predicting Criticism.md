Technical presentations end up for badly because most people fail to do one simple thing.

Predict criticism from the audience.

Here are X common mistakes and how to rectify them:

#1: Not understanding failure points
- Your solution might work for one case, but you need to consider cases where it won't work, and why.
- Address failure points, and have alternative solutions for those cases.

#2: Not having substantive evidence
- You need to convince the audience they're not looking at an outlier scenario.
- Show multiple data points, scenarios, or use-cases where there is a problem.
- And how your solution works (or does not) for all of them

#3: Not having any hypotheses
- It is always best if you can answer why something happens, because a technical audience always wants to know.
- It is not always possible, in which case, you need to have a hypothesis that you will prove or disprove.
- If that is not possible, explain what you are going to do to formulate one.

#4: Not explaining why its important
- Nobody likes rabbit holes without understanding why something is important.
