Superheterodyning is an essential concept for automotive radar. 👇🏼

Here is a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system.

The received FM signal has a different instantaneous frequency compared to the transmitted signal depending on the location and velocity of the target.

Received signal is mixed with the transmitted signal to generate an IF that is proportional to the distance or velocity of the object.

Simple and effective.
