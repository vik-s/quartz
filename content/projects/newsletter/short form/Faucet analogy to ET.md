Here is the simplest analogy to envelope tracking in amplifiers. 👇🏼

Envelope Tracking or ET is a technique to increase the efficiency of power amplifiers.

Efficiency is increased by reducing wasteful power dissipation.

But how? Here's the analogy.

The best way to save water while brushing your teeth is to turn off the faucet when no water is necessary. Turn it back on when needed.

ET does the same thing in an amplifier. It shuts off the power supply to a trickle when the envelope of the RF signal does not require a high value for amplification.

And boosts it when the signal level rises so more power can be delivered for amplification.
