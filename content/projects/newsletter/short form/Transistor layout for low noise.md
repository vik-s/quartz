Want low noise from your MOS devices? Pay attention to the layout. 👇🏼

Gate resistance is a dominant source of noise and must be reduced at all costs.

Here are some methods you can apply right away:

💥 Use narrow width devices
💥 Use multiple gate fingers in parallel
💥 Contact the gate polysilicon on both ends
💥 Route to the device with low resistance lines

Bam. You just elevated your design just like that.

Screw this up, and pay the price.
