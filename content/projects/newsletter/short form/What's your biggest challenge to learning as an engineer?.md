What's your biggest obstacle in learning engineering? Let me know üëáüèº  
  
I've interacted with a few people who expressed that they would really like to learn engineering (specifically RF) but don't know where to start.  
  
I'd really love to know what your pain points are.  
  
It will really help me tailor my newsletter content better.

Repost (‚ôªÔ∏è) if you think others are having trouble with RF too.

- Hi Vikram, One topic of suggestion that can be better disseminated would be the rigorous design procedures for high-frequency high-power RF sources using switching and bridge topologies, as used in laser pump sources. It requires both LT Spice and ADS, and even before that perhaps a discussion of topologies, failures modes, etc. Most of these sources work at ~ 80MHz, and some of the bigger lasers require pump power of the tune of 10kW or more. Hope you can help get the right people together to contribute and put together this primer! I'd be happy to help.
- It is not possible to escape Maxwell equations, Transmission line theory (Basically Pozar). However those who are not interested in mathematics, should have video tutorials to explain Maxwell equations, how these are to be digitised for simulation and their practical significance including matched boundary layers or computing domain /space. Same applies to Transmission lines , how these to be used as indusctor or capacitor or resonance circuit or bias line. Visual tutorials explaining these matter will be a great help for new comers as they can watch these at their own pace. . Companies can ask experienced mentors to prepare these with help from video editors.
- One of the challenges in my opinion is the lack of good RF mentors. It would be great if people who have a (practical) legacy in the industry came forward and shared their knowledge, experience, tips, and tricks, wrote a book, etc. Of course, the books written 50-100 years ago are still some of the best resources to understand the theoretical aspect but there are only a handful of YouTube channels, and training courses that focus on practical and hands-on aspects of the RF world. As opposed to other engineering domains for which you would probably find at least 50-100x times more resources out there. Experts and pioneers in other domains (Machine learning, programming, AI, Project management, leadership, autonomous cars, startup founders, etc.) have one or multiple mediums through which they share their experience and knowledge with the next generation (sometimes free, sometimes paid) but I have not seen (and pardon my ignorance, if any) such an initiative from anyone who would be considered as one of the pioneers in the development and progress of RF industry. I have also rarely seen anyone going back to academics as a professor after years of service in the RF industry. I understand not everyone might have this option though.
- Very few people are taking RF/Microwaves now-a-days because the "returns" are less in this field. What you design will hardly work first time and you will have no idea where it went wrong. The simulation tools help to a great extent, but everything cannot be simulated. Everything literally 'comes' by experience. By the time you gain experience, you are out of the field.. Best thing is to learn from others' mistakes and keep learning in the parallel fields (of RF) like Mechanical / PCB mfg techniques / Physics etc.
- I think biggest hurdle for beginners is not having intuitive understanding of electromagnetic waves. Gaining good practical knowledge on radio or high frequency signals helps to know whole system understanding.
- Biggest challengeg in rf and microwave to understanding of electromagnetic wave in depth more important to basics. Second thing area of interest.
- RF is a complex field and trial and error are all part of honing skills. But isn't everything? Malcolm Gladwell popularised the 10,000 hours concept but basically you can't short cut time against the coal face. With very few highly experienced engineers to learn its tough finding the right RF role models. It also requires an understanding of other traditionally separate engineering disciplines - mechanical and digital. We've found a way of developing RF talent quickly - with the right encouragement, projects and mindset it is possible and its an extremely exciting space to be in!
- I think one of the hardest things is getting the fundamentals right. Cause if you go wrong there then things become way too hard when you learn advanced stuff. I would love it if you made a series of posts on RF Fundamentals üòÅ
- My biggest problem is finding where to start and how to check yourself along the way. I often get bogged down with all that I feel I need to learn and it gets tough to find a single path to learn through
