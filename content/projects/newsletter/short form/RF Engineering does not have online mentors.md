One of the challenges in my opinion is the lack of good RF mentors. It would be great if people who have a (practical) legacy in the industry came forward and shared their knowledge, experience, tips, and tricks, wrote a book, etc. Of course, the books written 50-100 years ago are still some of the best resources to understand the theoretical aspect but there are only a handful of YouTube channels, and training courses that focus on practical and hands-on aspects of the RF world. As opposed to other engineering domains for which you would probably find at least 50-100x times more resources out there.  
  
Experts and pioneers in other domains (Machine learning, programming, AI, Project management, leadership, autonomous cars, startup founders, etc.) have one or multiple mediums through which they share their experience and knowledge with the next generation (sometimes free, sometimes paid) but I have not seen (and pardon my ignorance, if any) such an initiative from anyone who would be considered as one of the pioneers in the development and progress of RF industry. I have also rarely seen anyone going back to academics as a professor after years of service in the RF industry. I understand not everyone might have this option though.

Very few people are taking RF/Microwaves now-a-days because the "returns" are less in this field. What you design will hardly work first time and you will have no idea where it went wrong. The simulation tools help to a great extent, but everything cannot be simulated. Everything literally 'comes' by experience. By the time you gain experience, you are out of the field.. Best thing is to learn from others' mistakes and keep learning in the parallel fields (of RF) like Mechanical / PCB mfg techniques / Physics etc.

With very few highly experienced engineers to learn its tough finding the right RF role models. It also requires an understanding of other traditionally separate engineering disciplines - mechanical and digital. We've found a way of developing RF talent quickly - with the right encouragement, projects and mindset it is possible and its an extremely exciting space to be in!
