Every year there are over a million road accidents and fatalities worldwide. 👇🏼

Vision Zero is a project aimed at making this number zero, using policy, technology and design.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are the future for making this happen.

For this we need a combination of:
- Cameras
- Radar
- Lidar
- Ultrasonics

Each has pros and cons.

Radar is useful for:
- "seeing" in low-visibility conditions where cameras don't work
- providing distance, depth and velocity estimations where cameras cannot
- better proximity sensors where ultrasound fails to measure closeby objects

Radar technology is a mix of analog and digital realms. A beacon of interdisciplinary engineering.
