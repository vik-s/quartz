The optimum order of companies to work in (that I stumbled across):ðŸ‘‡

After graduating, most people are happy to join "big name" tech company. You get: 
â‡¾ Brand recognition
â‡¾ Sizable paycheck

This is NOT optimal in the long run.

The optimum order is:
Small â‡¾ Medium â‡¾ Large

â‡¾ In small companies you do everything. You see the product from concept to customer. You do design, layout, test and everything in between. The learning opportunities are immense; you work closely with key leadership.

â‡¾ In medium-sized companies, you deliver on your expertise but other aspects of product development are still accessible. You won't do all the work, but you will learn the business at reasonable scale. You will learn to work with larger groups of people.

â‡¾ In large companies, you are expected to deliver on your expertise. There are little opportunities to see a product from start to finish due to size of teams involved. But, these companies have the best and brightest and you can take your skills to the next level by learning from them (provided your level is already high).

Reverse the order, and you lose the chance to pick up vital skills early in your career.

I realize we don't always get to choose, but my career took this path totally by chance.

Also consider this important fact:
â‡¾ Random internet dudes saying stuff may not apply to your specific situation ðŸ˜„

But I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments nevertheless!
