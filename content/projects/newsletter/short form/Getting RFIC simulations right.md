Ever been nervous that your RF design might fail to work as intended?

You've done the design. Now you feel an awkward nervousness while your design is being manufactured.

Finally the design comes back.

It is measured in the lab, and:
- gain is too low
- frequency response is offset
- nonlinearity is not meeting spec
- there are things happening you cant explain

In 12+ years of doing RF engineering, I've learned from my mistakes.

I found that there is a way to methodically minimize these problems.

They involve:
- understanding validity of active models
- calibrating your passive modeling method
- using EM-cosimulation from chip to PCB
- validating and iterating on your learnings

In Sunday's newsletter, I will tell you exactly how to increase certainty in your RF design will work. Join 2,100+ others at the link below.
