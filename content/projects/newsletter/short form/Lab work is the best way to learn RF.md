The most underrated way to learn RF engineering is this:👇🏼

Learn to make accurate RF measurements by working in a lab.

Here is why its important:
↳ You will understand real-world issues
↳ You will learn how the environment affects your design
↳ You will appreciate difficulty in making repeatable designs
↳ Identifying sources of error will make you a better engineer

Learn how to use a:
↳ Network Analyzer
↳ Spectrum Analyzer
↳ Oscilloscope
↳ Signal Generator
↳ Power Meter

Once you learn manual measurements, automate it.
Use Labview, Matlab, Python or C#.

When starting out in your career:
↳ Don't rely on measurement teams
↳ Get in the lab and learn; ask if you can do it
↳ Learn what can break equipment, and avoid them
↳ Make mistakes, learn, repeat.
