John got an action item from his weekly RF meeting. ðŸ“…

The team received some high-current measurements that used an old bias-tee.

John's boss wants to make sure that the DC port was terminated in 50 ohms, and asks him to include that in his simulations while comparing to measurements.

John is resourceful. He manages to find a simple equivalent circuit of the bias tee and build that in a circuit simulator.

Which of these approaches will help John keep his job? Why? Why not?
