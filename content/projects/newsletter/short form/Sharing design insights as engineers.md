- We are afraid of sharing our design insights for many reasons
	- We consider it our secret sauce for earning a paycheck
	- Afraid that it might give away company's trade secrets
- The advantages of sharing design insights:
	- It establishes your domain authority
	- Improves your network in the field
	- Helps other improve and the profession as a whole
	- Writing to share improves your own design insight
	- Community participation gives you insights you didn't even know you didn't know
	- Help you stay excited and not siloed (as it happens in big companies)
