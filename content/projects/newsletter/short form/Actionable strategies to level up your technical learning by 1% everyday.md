5 step actionable strategy you can use to level up your technical learning by 1% everyday.

Getting just 1% better at your craft every day will make you 37 times better in a year. 

Here is the process:

- Log your unknowns
	- If you come across a term or concept you don't understand, note it down.
	- I keep a small notebook for this, but you could use your phone to make a note or record it on your phone.
	- Example: "What does Envelope Tracking mean?" "What are Doherty amplifiers?"
- Review and reorder
	- Read through your log and group concepts that may be related.
	- Find the underlying idea that is common to several of your unknowns.
	- Example: "Learn about efficiency enhancement techniques in amplifiers"
- Find your learning resource.
	- Find articles online that explain the concept in simple terms.
	- Blogs, substacks, articles and even textbooks are a good starting point.
	- Example: Here is what I wrote on Envelope Tracking. (link)
- Read for high level understanding
	- Understand the fundamental principle of what it is, and how it works.
	- Equations and complexities can overwhelm you; in subsequent iterations, you can get into it.
	- Example: Envelope Track means you change the supply voltage to save power.
- Write it down, and log your unknowns
	- Take some time to write it down as you would explain it to somebody.
	- This is the best way to cement your understanding.
	- Example: "What are envelope amplifiers?"

Repeat the process the next day. The idea is to just learn one little thing and write it down. The complexity of what you learn will grow as you add up your little learnings.
