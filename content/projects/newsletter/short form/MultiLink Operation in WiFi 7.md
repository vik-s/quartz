- This is one of the most prominent features in WiFi 7. MultiLink Operation (MLO) allows for the use of multiple simultaneous connections between access points over different channels, and even different frequency bands.
- Earlier WiFi generations made connections only over a single channel at a single frequency band. Even a triband WiFi 6E router connects devices on a single band over a fixed channel. If the connection quality was poor, the router had to manually switch over to a more reliable one.
- With MLO, there is significant improvement in reliability of the connection due to multiple redundant links being made simultaneously in addition to speed and latency improvements.
