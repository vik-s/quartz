# A Simple 3-Part Framework That Will Capture Your Engineering Audience

A *dead-simple framework* I use to make engineering presentations that people will listen to: 

I call it the **"Why-What-How"**

**The "Why"**
- Why is this a problem?
- Why does your solution work?
- Why does this improve the status-quo?

**The "What"**
- What exactly did you do to solve it?
- What kind of improvement did you achieve?
- Explain the idea behind your solution in one sentence

**The "How"**
- How did you implement your solution?
- How can others use/replicate your idea?
- Provide resources (code/workspaces) for others to dig into.

You've done the hard work.

Use this simple framework to showcase it well.

# Expanded Version

Most technical presentations are boring. 

The speaker too often dives into the details without proper context. The audience is not told why they have to listen and wonder where the speaker is going with this. As a result, they often mentally switch off and start to drift away.

To add to the problem, since so many meetings are held online, you can be rest assured that your audience will be playing solitaire on their secondary monitor if you fail to capture their interest. You fail to do justice to your own work by not showcasing it properly.

There is a simple fix to make technical presentations more interesting.

Over the last 13+ years of working in engineering, I have seen hundreds of presentations given by people all over the world. The best presentations I have seen often have a simple structure to them.

In this article, I have distilled my observations into a simple framework to make engineering presentations that people actually listen to.

I call it the "Why-What-How" framework and here is how it works.
### The WHY

The first thing you mention in your technical presentation is WHY you are talking about it in the first place.

Let's take an example from hardware engineering. Assume that you have improved on a particular spec in a product design. 

You start by explaining exactly why you are making this presentation and why working on this problem is important, with firm metrics if possible.

> "The purpose of today's presentation is to demonstrate an improvement in {feature} compared to our last product iteration. This is important because we were not meeting {customer X}'s spec, and we can potentially deliver {$X million} in revenue if this were improved."

Great. Now the audience knows why they are there and they're all ears because your work has a clear impact on the company's business. 

It doesn't not have to be a financial metric if you can't pin one down. You can point out the importance in many other ways -- applicability to other products, reduction of design cycle time, improvements in accuracy, or any other metric that underscores the impact of your work.

### The WHAT

Now that your audience understands why they are listening to you, you need to tell them WHAT exactly you did in one simple sentence.

Let's continue the same example from earlier.

> "The improvement is possible because of {reason} and I used"


### The HOW

- What exactly did you do to solve it?
- What kind of improvement did you achieve?
- Explain the idea behind your solution in one sentence
