# A Simple 3-Part Framework That Will Capture Your Engineering Audience

A *dead-simple framework* I use to make engineering presentations that people will listen to: 

I call it the **"Why-What-How"**

**The "Why"**
- Why is this a problem?
- Why does your solution work?
- Why does this improve the status-quo?

**The "What"**
- What exactly did you do to solve it?
- What kind of improvement did you achieve?
- Explain the idea behind your solution in one sentence

**The "How"**
- How did you implement your solution?
- How can others use/replicate your idea?
- Provide resources (code/workspaces) for others to dig into.

You've done the hard work.

Use this simple framework to showcase it well.

# Expanded Version

Most technical presentations are boring. 

The speaker too often dives into the details without proper context. The audience is not told why they have to listen and wonder where the speaker is going with this. As a result, they often mentally switch off and start to drift away.

It does not have to be this way.

Over the last 13+ years of working in engineering, I have seen hundreds of presentations given by people all over the world. The best presentations I have seen often have a simple structure to them.

In this article, I have distilled my observations into a dead simple framework to make engineering presentations that people will actually listen to.

I call it the "Why-What-How" framework.

Let's dig into it.

### The WHY

The first thing you mention in your technical presentation is WHY you are talking about it in the first place.

Let's take an example from hardware engineering. Assume that you have improved on a particular spec in a product design. 

You start by telling exactly why you are making this presentation and why working on this problem is important with firm metrics if possible.

> "The purpose of today's presentation is to demonstrate an improvement in {feature} compared to our last product iteration. This is important because we were not meeting {customer X}'s spec, and we can potentially deliver {$X million} in revenue if this were improved."

Great. Now the audience knows why they are there and they're all ears because your work has a clear impact on the company's business. 

It doesn't not have to be a financial metric if you can't pin one down. You can point out the importance in many other ways -- applicability to other products, reduction of design cycle time, improvements in accuracy, or any other metric that underscores the impact of your work.

Finally, you can briefly mention why your solution actually work. For example,

> "The approach I will present today shows optimizations to {block} based on {principle} that ensures that {bad things} do not happen under {conditions}."

So now the audience knows why they are listening to you, and what ideas your solutions involve. This engages their interest.

- Why does your solution work?
- Why does this improve the status-quo?
