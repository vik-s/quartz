# A Simple 3-Part Framework That Will Capture Your Engineering Audience

A *dead-simple framework* I use to make engineering presentations that people will listen to: 

I call it the **"Why-What-How"**

**The "Why"**
- Why is this a problem?
- Why does your solution work?
- Why does this improve the status-quo?

**The "What"**
- What exactly did you do to solve it?
- What kind of improvement did you achieve?
- Explain the idea behind your solution in one sentence

**The "How"**
- How did you implement your solution?
- How can others use/replicate your idea?
- Provide resources (code/workspaces) for others to dig into.

You've done the hard work.

Use this simple framework to showcase it well.
