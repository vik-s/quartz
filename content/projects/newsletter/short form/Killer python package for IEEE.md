Easiest way to create IEEE publication quality plots with python. üëáüèº

This did not exist 12+ years ago when I did my PhD. I wish it did.

Here's how you do it.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install SciencePlots:
‚Ü≥ pip install SciencePlots

2Ô∏è‚É£ Import SciencePlots (along with Matplotlib)
‚Ü≥ import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
‚Ü≥ import scienceplots

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set the style to science + ieee in your python program:
‚Ü≥ plt.style.use(['science','ieee'])

Then plot as you usually would in Matplotlib.
- Get 600 DPI plots
- Width fits 1 column of IEEE paper
- Ensures that graph is legible in black and white

Get your work done quick with the right tools. 
Go get your life back.
