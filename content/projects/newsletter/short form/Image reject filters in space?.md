Do you need image reject filters in space? 👇🏼

Receivers in space are relatively free of the complex radio environment we face here on earth.

If you were making a superheterodyne receiver in space, would you still use image reject filters?

The answer is yes. You will still benefit in SNR when you reject thermal noise from the image frequency, which will otherwise down-convert into your IF spectrum.

Something to think about, before you deploy your killer electronic designs in space.
