You don't need SMART goals. You need a way to play the game for several decades. 👇🏼

This goes against what every corporation tells you. 

Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) goals work for your employer. 

Not you.

As an engineer, you need to treat your work as an infinite game.

Finite games have a definite outcome. A win. A loss. Zero sum.

Infinite games do not. You play for the fun of it.

When you play a finite engineering game, you're always looking for higher scores on tests, ways to impress your manager for a promotion, or strive towards a salary point.

Instead play the long, infinite game.

🔹 Try to build the best possible product you can as a personal challenge
🔹 Learn as much as you can about your engineering expertise
🔹 Find ways to help and inspire others as much as possible

You will find yourself doing better than most, while loving every step of the journey.
