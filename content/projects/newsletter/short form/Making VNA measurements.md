Before you even try, here are some basics you should know:

Set the VNA input power properly
↳ Not too high to compress receivers
↳ Not too low to destroy SNR

Set resolution as high as acceptable
↳ Too low, and your measurement takes forever
↳ Too high, and your measurement will not be clean

Take averages, but avoid smoothing
↳ Point or sweep averaging can improve noise floor
↳ Smoothing can give wrong results if used carelessly
