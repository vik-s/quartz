The tech world is moving faster than anyone can keep up. 👇🏼

Many engineers rely on the same knowledge they gained years ago, not realizing the impact it has on their careers. 

- They struggle to collaborate with newer colleagues, 
- find themselves overlooked for promotions
- can't tap into their full potential 
- miss out on the latest advancements

It's been over a decade since I graduated from graduate school, and the rapid pace of technology still catches me off guard. 

But here's the thing: staying updated isn't as daunting as it seems. 

Commit to learning something new each week, whether it's watching a YouTube video, reading a book chapter, or listening to a conference talk.
