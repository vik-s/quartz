What are the differences between LNA and PA designers? 👇🏽

LNA designers:
→ Obsess over gain and noise figure
→ Often use conjugate match at output
→ Optimize Q-factor of passives at input
→ Have bias points that don't vary with the signal
→ Deal with weak input signals

PA designers:
→ Obsess over power and efficiency
→ Always use power match at output
→ Optimize Q-factor of passives at output
→ Have dynamic bias points that vary with the signal
→ Try to increase input drive strength

What others? Let me know in the comments. ✍🏽
