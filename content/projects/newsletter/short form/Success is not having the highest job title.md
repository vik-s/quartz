All successes come at a cost. One you have to bear.

Success in corporate America means title, money or both.

Before you go all-in, consider these things:

1/ Enough
Define enough. How much money do you need to live a reasonable life? Reasonable means a comfortable roof over your head, ability to purchase your basic necessities and then some, and being able to get yourself places.

The answer is NOT - "More the better". Put a number on it. Evaluate what you spend now, estimate what you will need and add some cushion. Step back and look at it. If you put in a 8-figure number, do the exercise again.

2/ Family
Make time for truly meaningful relationships in life. Play with your kids. Go for a movie night with your spouse. Call your parents. Time will slide past before you realize. 

Your meetings, deadlines and bosses are replaceable. Your loved ones are not.

3/ Purpose
Don't put off what you find meaningful for "when you have the time." Spend time on your hobbies. Start that side-project.  Learn the thing you always wanted to. Take that holiday with your family while it still matters.

If you find meaning in your work, ask yourself if that is everything you wanted out of life? Is this what you aspired to be as a child?

4/ Time
Money can compound. Not time. It continuously depletes. If you are putting in ungodly amount of time into your corporate job, ask yourself what you are getting in return and if you really need it. 

Deploy time for maximum fulfillment, not just money or title. There are times where you have to grind, and times you should not be doing so. Make sure you are balancing it right based on 1, 2, 3 above. 

5/ Health
If your corporate job is keeping you from working out, eating and sleeping well, and staying healthy, this is NOT a price you want to pay. Scale back as required. Your physical wellbeing translates to your mental wellbeing and affects you and those around you.

Remember, a healthy person has many wishes but an sick person has just one.
