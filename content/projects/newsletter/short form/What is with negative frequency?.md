Have you ever seen negative frequency in textbooks? Here is what it means: 👇🏼

First, here's the shift needed: Think of signals in complex sinusoids. exp^(jwt).

Then, every signal has an "in-phase" cosine and "quadrature" sine component.

With positive and negative exponent in a complex sinusoid, a cosine or sine can be represented by the polar plots shown below.

Positive frequency term goes anti-clockwise.
Negative frequency term goes clockwise.

The sum of the two always cancels out the imaginary part. Real parts add up.

A negative frequency is simply a change in direction, but is necessary to ensure that a signal is mathematically a purely real quantity.
