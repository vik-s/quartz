Give yourself harsher deadlines.

Work balloons to fill the time that you give it. So give it less.

Use "Roosevelt Dashes" to get more done in lesser time üëáüèº:

Theodore Roosevelt had an amazing array of interests ranging from body building to naturalism, but he still did well in his classes at Harvard. He was not at the top of his class but he did quite well. His interests left him very little time to actually focus on academics and therefore he worked on school work for only short periods of time but with *blistering intensity*.

Here is how we can adopt this strategy: identify a deep work, high priority task and give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces the time usually taken to do such a task. Make it even harder by publicly proclaiming that deadline, and set a countdown timer and set to work on it. 

Always make sure you keep Roosevelt dashes on the edge of feasibility, where the successful completion of the task will require levels of concentration higher than usual. It provides interval training for the brain.

I've applied this at work where I give myself very specific tasks to complete in a borderline absurd amount of time. Am I successful always? No.

The idea is to avoid procrastination and get it done. It can always be edited later.

Here's a counterintuitive way to get more work done in less time.üëáüèº

Give yourself harsher deadlines.

Parkinson's law: Work balloons to fill the time allotted.

So give it less.

In his book Deep Work, Cal Newport explains how "Roosevelt Dashes" just get it done.

See Teddy Roosevelt was a prolific multitasker. A body builder, naturalist, ornithologist, rower, and boxer. He still graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. How?

His secret was to use short periods of time for school work but do it with BLISTERING INTENSITY.

Here's how you can apply this:
- Pick a task that is hard to complete in 2 hours.
- Remove all distractions - phone, chat, ...
- Set a timer for 90 mins.
- Hit it hard.

You'll be amazed what you'll accomplish.
