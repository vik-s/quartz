6 reasons why Silicon-on-Insulator technology is the workhorse of RF front end switching. 👇🏼

⚡️ Low substrate capacitance allows transistor stacking ‭‭→ voltage handling
⚡️ Low ON resistance and low OFF capacitance → wide bandwidth
⚡️ Insulating oxide layer to isolate devices from silicon → no latch up issues
⚡️ Oxide + high resistivity silicon substrate → high linearity
⚡️ Silicon → control circuits can be implemented
⚡️ Better radiation hardness → good for space stuff

Other technologies have their uses in specific applications too.

But SOI switches are just awesome.
