3 techniques you should know to account for variations in your design simulations: 👇🏼

Corner simulations:
↳ These represent the movement of design parameters to either the best or worst case. Extent of movement is commonly 3-sigma. This will give you a good idea how you good or bad your design will look.

Monte-Carlo simulations:
↳ Define a range over which your parameters can vary. Randomly vary these parameters in each simulation. Most simulations will fall around nominal design, but the more simulations you run, the more you can identify outlier performance.

Pareto analysis:
↳ Some EDA tools allow you to define a bunch of variable parameters. The tool will run a set of simulations to identify which parameters affect the design the most, and give you a ranked list of "big knobs" that affect design the most - a pareto chart.

Use these tools to understand manufacturability of your designs.

Don't leave home without them.
