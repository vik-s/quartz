Most people dread putting technical presentations together before a meeting.

Here is a 6-step process I've used for 12+ years that you can replicate every time:

#1: Prep the PPT
- Most people start from a blank PPT and get stuck
- By prepping the PPT, you don't start from zero
- Instead, use a blank PPT as an engineering journal

#2: The Engineering Journal
- Write the PPT as you work.
- Write down thoughts (why/what/how)
- Copy paste pictures to explain your work

#3: Outline your Content
- Look through your journal and create an outline
- List out the topics you will discuss in a logical order
- Use the why/what/how approach to keep the listener's attention

#4: Describe Key Ideas
- Based on the outline, fill in your PPT content
- Simply reuse what you already have in your Journal
- Always try to use single sentences, not blocks of text

#5: Predict Criticism
- Poke holes in your work and address them
- Put in substantive evidence for your claims
- If you haven't addressed something yet, say so

#6: Plan Future Work
- What do you want to look at next?
- Where do you see this project going?
- Communicate any timelines/schedules you have

Knowing that you have a process will make it easy every single time. It's just a matter of getting it done.
