The future of RF front end filtering is not SAW or BAW. 👇🏼

As frequencies increase, acoustic-wave filters have been struggling to keep up.

The gold rush is over.

But SAW/BAW Innovations are still happening:
- Incredible high performance SAW from Murata
- XBar filters from Resonant Inc. (acq. by Murata)
- XBaw filters from Akoustis

LC filters in LTCC and IPD technologies have emerged for 5G. 

They have limited rejection and Q-factor capabilities.

So this is what the future holds:

SAW/BAW + LC lumped element filters 🤯 

Published work is showing promise.

Maybe we will see companies doing this emerge and create disruptive technologies.
