Here's what a good RF fundamentals bootcamp should look like: 👇🏼

1. Network Theory - learn impedances, S/Z/Y matrices
2. Electromagnetics - Gauss law, ampere's law, maxwells equations, visualize fields
3. Antenna fundamentals - basic terminology and operating principle
4. Transmission lines - telegrapher equations (waveguides optional)
5. Passive microwave circuits - couplers, power dividers, basic filters
6. Basic RF devices - mosfets, BJTs
7. Active microwave circuits - Amplifiers and mixers
8. RF systems - block diagram, performance design, modulation basics

I do understand each of these can be their own book.  The absolute basics of each topic can still be taught in a reasonable way. 

Most engineering work outside of cutting edge research still relies on the fundamentals.
