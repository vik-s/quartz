We may have 5G, but this 60 kHz signal keeps the United States ticking: 👇🏼

Radio station WWVB transmits a 1 bit/s signal to synchronize radio clocks. 
↳ It uses both pulse width modulation (PWM) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK)

It uses two vertical dipole antennas spaced 857m apart.
↳ At 60 kHz, quarter wavelength is 1250m. But each antenna is 1/10 this height.
↳ Some missing length was added horizontally right on top.
↳ But its still too short and loses efficiency.

The combined efficiency of the antennas is about 69%. 

A computer is used to dynamically match the antenna and transmitter system during cold/icy conditions.

It uses massive transmitters to generate an effective radiated power of 70 kW.
