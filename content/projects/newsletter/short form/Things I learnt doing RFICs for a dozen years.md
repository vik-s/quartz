6 RFIC lessons I learned from 12 years of industry experience: 👇🏼

☑︎ Floorplanning
↳ Experiment with placing your passives. 
↳ It has the biggest ROI on performance.

☑︎ Electromagnetics
↳ Simulate. Everything. 
↳ Higher the frequency, the more every little thing matters.

☑︎ Density Fill
↳ Necessary evil that is too complex to simulate. 
↳ Keep it far from your critical traces.

☑︎ Device Models
↳ Question its accuracy. It's only a model; not the real thing.
↳ DC, high frequency, nonlinear, transient; Its a lot to ask from a model.

☑︎ Parasitic extraction
↳ Routing to and around the transistor matters, account for them.
↳ Avoid double counting parasitics

☑︎ Packaging
↳ It changes everything. Account for it via EM simulation.
↳ Chip+package+PCB+connector. Take it all into account.
