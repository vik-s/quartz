What I did, and would do again to get through grad school FAST: 👇🏼

🧠 Understand your advisor's expectations:
↳ What are possible areas of research?
↳ How many conference and journal papers?
↳ Estimated time to completion?

🤺 Attack your working hours with gusto:
↳ Don't browse internet and read news
↳ Write a work log including start/stop times
↳ Go for walks when you're stuck

📈 Analyze stats from your field's publications:
↳ Sort the papers published based on topic
↳ Identify if a journal publishes more on a given topic
↳ Attack that publication and that topic

✍🏼 Write your paper while you do research:
↳ Your paper is a story that answers the why and how
↳ Writing as you go will give you clear direction
↳ Way easier than sitting down to write at the end

What other tricks do you know of?
