Here are the top python frameworks I use as an RF engineer and why: 👇

🔧 General-purpose:

↳Scikit-RF: https://scikit-rf.org
The workhorse. Parses touchstone files. Supports matplotlib plots and smith charts.

↳Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org
Data processing using jupyter notebooks. CSV import/export.

↳Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org
Basic plotting. Plenty of online examples for making good looking plots.

↳Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org
Stats baby! Advanced plotting instantly makes my PPTs awesome.

↳Plotly: https://plotly.com
Easy to make data dashboards/apps. One of the few packages that natively support smith charts.

📏 Measurement:

↳pyvisa: https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
The comprehensive lab measurement package using GPIB, USB, etc. 

↳pymeasure: https://pymeasure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
A high level wrapper for pyvisa that has a bunch of readily available instruments.

🤌 Tool specific:

↳Keysight python API:https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/resources/miscellaneous/eda-software/python-eda.html
ADS has a python interface, but I use the python interface to ICCAP a lot.
I'm a device modeling guy, what can i say.

↳pyAEDT: https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/
I don't do much EM stuff at work nowadays but this looks awesome.

If there are other awesome packages you use, let me know in the comments below.
