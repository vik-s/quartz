Class B has a 180° conduction angle. What does that mean? 👇🏽

The transistor is "on" only for 1/2 the sinusoidal signal.

And "off" for the rest of the time.

Then the magic happens:
→ RF output power is unaffected
→ PAE is boosted from 50% (in class A) to 78.5%

Your office might have Taco Tuesdays but there is no free lunch in engineering.

In this week's post, you'll find out what happens.
