Here's a simple design procedure for a Class A amplifier. 👇🏽

→ Identify the active device that meets power needs
→ Determine Q-point for linear opearation
→ Find the optimum load, Ropt
→ Design the load matching network to implement Ropt
→ Design the input match network for good gain
→ Verify the design with simulators
