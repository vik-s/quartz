Want to transmit a complex signal exp^(jwt) from the lab to your friends office? 👇🏼

- Take two sinusoidal signal generators set to the same frequency f0.
- Phase shift one of the signals by 90 degrees.
- Connect cables to both the original and 90 degree shifted signals.
- Connect them to the horizontal and vertical channels of an oscilloscope, respectively.
- You will see a spot rotating anti-clockwise on the screen as shown below.

You are looking at the polar representation of a complex signal. 🤯

Bonus Q: Your colleague was too distracted reading this LinkedIn post, and swaps the cables on the oscilloscope. What do they see on the screen?
