Use of linear frequency modulation in pulsed radar is just 🔥 ...

Matched filtering is used to extract the received radar signal.

🔥 You get much better SNR compared to a constant frequency waveform
🔥 The extracted pulse is shorter than the transmitted pulse (pulse compression)
🔥 You can resolve objects that are much closer together.

If you want to know how FM and matched filtering are used to extract radar signals, check out the link below.
