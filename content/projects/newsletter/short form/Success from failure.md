Complex RF projects often see a lot of failure.

‚û¢ Physics is sometimes too complex to predict with the best of computer tools.
‚û¢ Designs are too complex to foresee and test every single point of failure.
‚û¢ Time constraints are real, projects need to finish before deadlines.
‚û¢ People are always knowledge limited, experience is finite.

The only thing we can do as RF engineers is to pick up the pieces, learn from our mistakes and move on.
