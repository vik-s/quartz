A key metric in power amplifiers is backoff efficiency: 👇🏽

PAs give best efficiency only when the signal swing is sufficiency high to drive it to saturation.

When the input power drops, the efficiency also drops.

A common FoM is 6-dB backoff efficiency, where the power drops to 1/4th, and the voltage and current waveforms drop by 1/2.

Here are some saturation and backoff efficiencies you should know.

Class A
→ Saturation: 50%
→ 6-dB backoff: 12.5%

Class B
→ Saturation: 78.5%
→ 6-dB backoff: 39.5%
