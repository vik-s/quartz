Class B amplifiers are sometimes OK for RF but not audio. Why? 👇🏽

Class B amplifiers provide a highly distorted output signal, but with good amplification efficiency.

For many RF applications, it is okay to distort the carrier signal as long as the modulation is not affected.

The baseband information can still be retrieved.

Class B won't work for audio.

It is a complex time-varying signal which needs to be accurately amplified. 

To still get Class B efficiencies, the push-pull amplifier was invented.

It is a differential version of a Class B amplifier that can produce amplification with good efficiency.
