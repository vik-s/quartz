| Ahmed Mohsen Emam                | ahmedmohsen23@gmail.com                              | I did not get the chance to do any RF tape-outs but there is a myth that I hear from many people on how hard it is to get an RFIC working after fabrication from the first time. Since, I am working on my Masters' Thesis in the RF field, it would be very helpful for me to know what usually can go wrong after fabrication and why it is much more critical in RF than other design fields.                                                                                                                                                                |
