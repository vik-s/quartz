In this article, we continue the discussion on automotive radars. Previously, we looked at how chirp signals are used to measure distance or range of objects. A lot of the fundamentals of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar are covered in the article below.

Next, we looked at how to estimate velocity using the phase of the intermediate frequency signal that was obtained while mixing the transmitted and received chirps together using a two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that used individual FFTs to estimate the range (across the fast time axis) and velocity (across the slow time axis). The concepts in this article are essential in understanding the measurement of angles of arrival with FMCW radar. It will help if you've already absorbed those ideas.

In this article, we will focus on the estimation of angle of arrival of objects using multiple antennas. Specifically we will cover:

## Understanding the Radar Cuboid*

fn: Literature calls it a Radar Cube, but I refuse to use that nomenclature because it implies all dimensions of cube are the same. As we will see quite quickly, it is almost never so. A more accurate term is cuboid, even if it does not roll off the tongue.

Here's the scenario. There is a transmitting antenna that emits a chirp frame that is reflected off an object located far away, and is received by multiple antennas each spaced a distance *p* apart. For our discussion, it does not matter if the object is moving or stationery. Our purpose is to evaluate the relative angle Î¸ of the object to the radar receiver.

*Put picture of one tx and 2 rx antennas with all angle indications*

Just like before, a received chirp is converted to IF, digitized by the ADC and an "in-line" FFT is calculated by the hardware accelerated, FFT-optimized radar chip on board the system. On the first axis, we get the range FFT from which we can identify the peaks to directly relate the IF signal frequency to distance. The size of this dimension depends on the FFT length used to calculate range (like 256 or 512).

Remember that we are collecting data simultaneously on multiple antennas. So along the second axis will be the range FFT for each antenna, per chirp. In other words, along the second axis, at any point in time, you will have range FFT data corresponding to any given antenna, for a particular chirp. The size of this dimension depends on how many receiving antennas are present (like 3 or 4).

On the third axis, you will have range FFT data corresponding to each antenna, for every chirp in the frame. Along this axis, doppler FFT is calculated to extract the velocity of the objects in the radar field of view. The size of this dimension depends on how many chirps there are in a frame (like 256).

*Draw a radar cuboid*

In essence, this is the basic data structure received by the radar receiver for every frame. The range, velocity and angle of arrival is estimated from this 3-dimensional data object.
## Estimating Angle of Arrival

Let us simplify our analysis to the case where there are only two receiving antennas. Depending on the location of the object, the chirp signal will travel an extra distance Î”p to one antenna compared to the other. If the distance between the antennas is p, then Î”p=p.sinÎ¸. From our last article (https://www.viksnewsletter.com/i/145685890/velocity-measurement-from-phase) we know that an extra distance Î”p results in a phase shift Î”Î¦ given by
$$ \Delta\phi = 2\pi f_c.\Delta t = 2\pi f_c.\frac{p.\sin(\theta)}{c} = 2\pi.\frac{p\sin\theta}{\lambda_c} $$
where Î»c and fc is the signal wavelength and frequency respectively.

We can elegantly calculate the angle of arrival from the phase shift between the signals of the two antennas.
$$ \theta = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{\Delta\phi \lambda_c}{2\pi p} \right)$$
While velocity measurement from phase shift was a linear relationship, the measurement of angle of arrival is not. The inverse trigonometric relationship makes it inherently nonlinear. The relationship between phase shift and angle of arrival is relatively linear for angles close to zero degrees, and becomes significantly nonlinear as the angles approach Â±Ï€/2. Thus, **the angle of arrival estimation is most accurate when the object's location is somewhat in front of the receiver antenna, and gets less accurate for wider angles**.

Similar to the case of velocity measurement, the phase shift between antennas is unambiguous only if the total phase shift is less than Ï€ radians. Setting Î”Î¦=Ï€ in the above equation gives the maximum field of view of the multi-antenna system.
$$ \theta_{max} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\lambda_c}{2p}\right) $$
Spacing the antennas half a wavelength apart (p=Î»c/2) gives the maximum field of view, Î¸max = Â±Ï€/2. This is the same condition needed in antenna arrays (https://www.viksnewsletter.com/p/fundamentals-of-antenna-arrays?r=222kot&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) to use constructive and destructive interference patterns to produce the most focused beams with minimal grating lobes. I'm always amazed when dots connect.
