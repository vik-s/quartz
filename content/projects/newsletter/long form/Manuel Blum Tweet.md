He invented CAPTCHA but...

Manuel Blum - a Turing Award winner - had 3 students who won the Turing Award themselves, apart from others who won Knuth and Godel prizes.

These are the HIGHEST honors in computer science - all from the same advisor.

But, what was so special about his mentorship?

Every weekly meeting he held with his students had ONE purpose only.

It was so that Blum could learn from his students.

To answer all of Blum's questions, his students had to know their idea inside out. He truly believed in every one of their ideas and encouraged them to bring out the best in themselves.

If the ideas weren't good enough, Blum would happen to simply forget them before the next weekly meeting.

Was being a good listener his secret? It appears so.

If we have only had mentors who thought they knew more than you, or colleagues that thought they were better than you, then one can't help but wonder...

What would it be like, and what would have happened if we had someone like Blum in our lives?
