One of my favorite online writers, Venkatesh Rao, recently wrote about the [Flaubert Frontier](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-flaubert-frontier?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), which describes the need for order in daily life to be original in one's creative work. Based on my recent travels to and from Bangalore, my sense of daily order has fallen to the way side and routines broken. So, instead of writing a heavy technical article this time, I figured there's more way than deliver useful content.

This week's article is directed towards those considering a graduate degree in engineering or specifically looking to advance their career in the field of RF engineering. It's not as much career advice as it is a recounting of my experience and parts that I found helpful in my own journey. But why this topic?

During my podcast interview on Tejas Ketkar's YouTube channel, Tejas asked me some great pointed questions about my experience in getting a Masters and PhD in Electrical Engineering, and it got me thinking. I've also had similar discussions in my (now discontinued due to lack of time) 1:1 chats with readers who wanted some guidance on what the potential benefits of graduate degrees are and how it might shape their career. Folks were in my LinkedIn DMs and emails asking me how to go about learning RF engineering.

Meeting and talking to people has given me some insight into the problems people are facing in this field. In fact, if you live in the San Diego area, we are having a meetup at a local brewery and have an opportunity to talk and network more, sign up here if you can make it. 




Should I get a higher education?
- Doing a Masters
- Doing a PhD

Tips to attack a graduate degree effectively

Working in India vs working abroad
- Job abroad directly or go there for a masters and then get a job
- Pay is more abroad and so are expenses
	- downsides exist - immigration, lifestyle, food, family.
- Better work going abroad?
- Rise of semiconductors in india?

Will Semiconductors be more lucrative than Software in the future?

How does one get into RF, specifically RFIC? What learning resources are available?

What is it like to work in a small, medium or large company?

Advice to do well at work
- I value people who want to always learn and be better, dont shy away from hard problems but instead attack it head on, work hard when needed but has a life outside too, be brutally honest in your work to say you dont understand, and generally great to be around.
