One of my favorite online writers, Venkatesh Rao, recently wrote about the [Flaubert Frontier](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-flaubert-frontier?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), which describes the need for order in daily life to be original in one's creative work. Based on my recent travels to and from Bangalore, my sense of daily order has fallen to the way side and routines broken. So, instead of writing a heavy technical article, I figured there's more way than deliver useful content.

This week's article is directed towards those considering a graduate degree in engineering or specifically looking to advance their career in the field of RF engineering. It's not as much career advice as it is a recounting of my experience and parts that I found helpful in my own journey. But why this topic?

During my podcast interview on Tejas Ketkar's YouTube channel, Tejas asked me some great pointed questions about my experience in getting a Masters and PhD in Electrical Engineering, and it got me thinking. 

I've also had similar discussions in my (now discontinued due to lack of time) 1:1 chats with readers who wanted some guidance on what the potential benefits of graduate degrees are and how it might shape their career. Then there were people in my LinkedIn DMs and emails asking me how to go about learning RF engineering.

Meeting and talking to people has given me some insight into the problems people are facing in this field. In fact, if you live in the San Diego area, we are having a meetup at a local brewery and have an opportunity to talk and network more, sign up here if you can make it.

## A Brief History of Mine

I want to give you a brief timeline of what my graduate program looked like, and what I achieved during that time. This is *not* meant to be a humblebrag. Instead, I want to emphasize that clear direction and intention can really get things done. And how you can do it too.

I began my masters at Texas A&M University in Aug 2006, but it wasn't until about Feb 2007 that I switched to my graduate advisor Dr. Kamran Entesari. I defended my masters thesis in January 2009, and I had [one publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mmce.20393) to my name. In the summers of 2007 and 2008, I was an intern at Texas Instruments in the (now defunct) Wireless Technology Business Unit.

I had already decided that I would continue to my PhD because I knew the allure of a full-time paycheck is something I would not let go later. I was offered a six-figure job offer. Twice. Remember this was  pre-2008. Times were good. I turned it down both times. My mentor at Texas Instruments was proud of my decision. His words still ring clear in my head - "Stopping at a masters will limit your options. You should continue towards a PhD."

Also, I figured it would take lesser time if I continued my research towards a PhD. I really enjoyed doing research, so it was an easy decision in that sense. I wasn't really thinking if it was a good career move or not. It was a bucket list item I needed to complete.

There's one thing that helped me a lot even before I started. I asked for **clear expectations** from my advisor on what would define the end of my PhD. This is something I see a lot of people not doing, or I'm not sure if this is something professors don't clarify. **How many journal and conference papers do I need to graduate?** This sets a clear intention on what is expected of you, and what the finish line looks like. Without this goal post, PhD programs tend to go on forever.

I defended my PhD on February 14th, 2011, just about two years after I officially started it, and about 4.5 years from when I started my masters program. During this time, I had 7 journal papers and 9 conference papers in IEEE transactions, letters, and international symposiums. You can see my full track record [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AETOMgHJU5MnXZRa48ZDvRCSoLdFwmHNhhNTvcBmm8LNR3Zcz_8GwFrH4wtBC7KXzQ6ImbgOAaQVsRKRHxzhjw&user=pb7wZLcAAAAJ). I also won 3rd place in the 2011 IEEE International Microwave Symposium student paper competition.

I can hear some readers say, that's not always possible in all areas of engineering. Even getting one paper published in the Journal of Solid State Circuits or Nature, is achievement enough. I completely agree. If that is the nature of your field, then your advisor will set the correct expectation for you. Which is why it's important you ask.
## Should I do a Masters, a PhD?

Well, 2011 was a long time ago. You might ask - "Should I do a masters program in electrical engineering today?"

Short answer: Yes. The extra two years or so you spend doing a good masters program opens up a world of opportunity in the job market and introduces you to the way industry actually works.

Take for example the analog circuits course I took under [Prof. Jose Silva-Martinez](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/jsilvamartinez.html). His class covered all the ways real analog circuits and bias blocks were designed in industry. The course labs involved designing a circuit to a given specification, doing IC layout, and running parasitic extractions, all within a tight deadline. I now realize that this was a close emulation of the real world. 

I view a good masters program as an on-ramp to industry. And for many, this is a good place to stop. It gives you good bang for the buck. But should you really do a PhD?

I can't give you a short answer here, but I can say this: **Unless you plan on academia, a PhD program only makes sense if you can complete it with a reasonable span of time (4-5 years).** The reality is that PhDs don't get paid all that much more compared to masters students who joined industry (exceptions apply). And you have 5 years of opportunity cost to recover, which in the field of engineering can mean half a million dollars at least in the US. 

Money isn't everything. Doing a PhD opens even more doors to opportunities that take you to the cutting edge of a field. The excitement and satisfaction from a job on the frontier of technology can be fulfilling. Especially in the field of integrated circuits, it is crucial to develop the experience of taping out a chip from concept to implementation. Access to silicon is expensive, and hence most research institutions reserve it for students who really need to publish - the PhD students. On top of just tapeout experience, industry always wants people who are experts in certain areas of interest. Here are some examples:
- A PhD in device reliability will be ideal for foundries developing new technologies for production.
- A PhD in

Tips to attack a graduate degree effectively

Working in India vs working abroad
- Job abroad directly or go there for a masters and then get a job
- Pay is more abroad and so are expenses
	- downsides exist - immigration, lifestyle, food, family.
- Better work going abroad?
- Rise of semiconductors in india?

Will Semiconductors be more lucrative than Software in the future?

How does one get into RF, specifically RFIC? What learning resources are available?

What is it like to work in a small, medium or large company?

Advice to do well at work
- I value people who want to always learn and be better, dont shy away from hard problems but instead attack it head on, work hard when needed but has a life outside too, be brutally honest in your work to say you dont understand, and generally great to be around.
