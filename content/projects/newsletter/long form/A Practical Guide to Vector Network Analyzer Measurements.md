If there was only one laboratory instrument I'd learn to use as an RF engineer, it is the Vector Network Analyzer, or VNA, to measure scattering (S) parameters.

S-parameter measurements are the bedrock of RF engineering. They are used to calculate gain, matching, stability, noise, and efficiency, among other metrics. The process of measuring s-parameters involves sending an RF signal to a multiport device, and finding out the ratio of reflected and transmitted powers at each port. If you want a nice visual introduction to s-parameters, then check out this video.

I once attended a lecture by Prof. Andrea Ferrero, from Politecnico di Torino, who gave a talk on Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) measurements. His enthusiasm for the subject was infectious and his description of S parameter measurements with a VNA is something I never forgot.

The giant piece of ham is all the error in the system that needs to be calibrated out to make it sufficiently sensitive to measure the weight of a penny.

## Working of a Vector Network Analyzer

VNAs are extensively used to test the performance of one-port networks like antennas, two-ports like amplifiers or a multiports like power splitters or directional couplers. VNAs are most commonly available in two- and four-port configurations. It is called a vector analyzer because the magnitude and phase of s-parameters are measured. In contrast, scalar network analyzers do exist when there is no need for phase information.

Modern VNAs are extremely complicated machines which cost north of half a million dollars when configured with all the bells and whistles. Without going into too much detail, you can get a basic understanding of a VNA with the following block diagram.

 A frequency synthesizer provides a highly stable input signal that is applied to the device under test (DUT). Depending on the response of the DUT, part of the signal is reflected from each port, and part of it is transmitted. The goal of this system is to measure these reflected and transmitted powers.

Depending on whether we are making forward (from port 1 to 2) or reverse (from port 2 to 1) measurements, the switches connect the source to the test terminal, or to a 50 ohm reference impedance. For example, for forward measurements, port 1 is connected to the test terminal, and port 2 is terminated to 50 ohm.

The first input directional coupler samples the power that is being input to the DUT (R1). The second input directional coupler samples the reflected power from the input of the DUT (A). The ratio of these measured quantities (A/R1) gives S11.

Similarly, at the output, the first directional coupler measures the power incident at the output port (R2) and the second directional coupler measures the reflected power from the output power (B). The ratio of these measurements (B/R2) gives S22.

Accordingly, S21 and S12 are the ratios B/R1 and A/R2, respectively.

The measurements of the four quantities (A, B, R1, R2) are made with four receivers each of which employ a superheterodyne architecture with two intermediate frequency (IF) stages for best image frequency rejection. These are systems designed to have best signal detection possible. Component cost and power efficiency are not primary concerns like in communication receivers. Dual IF architecture uses more components but provides exceptional signal detection capability. 

Modern VNAs use a three receiver architecture to still save on component cost, by eliminating a reference receiver that is not being used by the incident signal and instead measuring "switch terms," a concept we will save for a future article. 

Regardless of the architecture (three or four receivers, 2 or 4 port), none of the components used in a VNA are ideal. Cables, couplers, amplifiers, filters, mixers all have losses associated with them that must be calibrated out. This is the "ham" we must carefully weigh our device measurements against.

The systematic errors in a four receiver (or sampler) VNA architecture can completely be characterized by what is called an 8-term error model, and the three sampler architecture by a 12-term error model. We will revisit these in a future article.

For now, we will only concern ourselves with practical ways to make good s-parameter measurements in the lab using a VNA. 

## A Step by Step Guide to Good VNA Measurements

The following steps are from my notes refined from about a decade of taking measurements with VNAs. Instead of considering these steps as hard-and-fast rules to abide by, you should view them as guidelines or a good starting point to develop your own measurement experience. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and every scenario is different. The purpose of our discussion here is to understand how to make the right trade-offs to get good measurements.
### Preset
Before starting up a calibration and measurement with a VNA, restore it to its preset state. You can do this in most VNAs from the 'System' menu. This way, you will have complete control over the configuration and not have any remnants of previous setups.

If you just turned on the instrument from power-off state, give it about 30 mins before use. This will allow low frequency transients to settle as the instrument reaches it's steady state.
### Frequency Range
Most VNAs cover measurement frequencies from the MHz to tens of GHz. Restrict the frequency range to *exactly* what you need, with the minimum number of frequency steps. If you have external components like bias tees or filters that inherently operate in a specific frequency range, there is no point in taking VNA measurements outside those ranges.  More frequencies usually do not tell you anything new, but increases measurement time. Time is better spent in capturing higher fidelity measurements using other settings we will describe later.

To be judicious about frequency points, you can do segmented frequency sweeps if your frequency sweep is not continuous. Use logarithmic frequency sweep if you need more data points at low frequencies. If you need certain operating frequencies to be included, list out spot frequencies if needed.

For the sake of accuracy, I personally never rely on frequency interpolation by the VNA. Interpolation here means that you are measuring "in-between" frequency points you did not explicitly calibrate for. VNAs are capable of interpolation, but I always explicitly define the frequencies I need, calibrate the instrument, and measure the DUT for those frequencies. With a little bit of planning, interpolation is usually not necessary.
### Resolution bandwidth
The receiver in the VNA has a programmable IF filter with adjustable bandwidth. In most VNAs, this is referred to as the resolution bandwidth (RBW). The smaller the bandwidth of this filter, the lower the noise in the measurement. Noise outside the IF bandwidth is filtered out. Due to lower noise, the VNA can measure very low level signals. The minimum measurable signal is called the receiver sensitivity, and the ratio of the maximum to minimum measurable signal is called dynamic range. A receiver that can measure low level signals is said to be highly sensitive, with high dynamic range.

State of the art VNAs have RBW values as low as 1 Hz, so why not just set it at that for lowest noise? It should give best receiver sensitivity, right? The trade-off here is measurement time. The settling time of IF filters is inversely proportional to its bandwidth. A low RBW gives high dynamic range but the measurement takes a longer time.

Setting RBW depends on what the requirements of your DUT are. For high rejection filters, you want high dynamic range to measure low level signals.  For device modeling measurements, I typically use about 30 Hz RBW because that gives me a good trade-off between measurement time and accuracy.

Usually, reducing IF bandwidth has a lower impact on measurement speed than using averaging to system noise floor. Therefore, make sure you set IF bandwidth to the largest acceptable value for your measurement.

### Taking Averages

There are two ways to take the average of measurements from a VNA. 

- **Sweep averaging**: The same frequency sweep is measured several times, and the average value at any frequency is calculated from the mean of the repeated sweeps. Doing this reduces noise by averaging it out, and improves dynamic range. Because the same measurement needs to be repeated several times, it directly impacts the measurement time. For example, taking ten averages improves the noise floor by 10 dB but increases the measurement time 10-fold. In practice, if setting the proper IF bandwidth gives me the noise floor I need, I do not use averaging. On occasion, I have used 3-10 averages for specific measurements, but anything more than that just takes too long for the kind of measurements I make.
- **Smoothing**: Smoothing uses a moving frequency window within which the average of the measured points are taken. Since it only averages adjacent points, it does not improve the noise floor or sensitivity of the measurement. It only smoothes out the measured line so that it does not appear noisy. Smoothing is usually not necessary as it can lead to confusion as we will see below.

Sweep averaging is usually acceptable because although it takes a long time, it does not obscure or misrepresent the data in any way. On the other hand, smoothing has the ability to wrongly interpret the actual performance of a DUT. If there is a spurious spike of narrow bandwidth in the measured response, smoothing will take the average of neighboring frequencies and the magnitude of the peaks will appear lower than what they really are. 

If you see smooth lines near the noise floor of the measurement, know that smoothing has been turned on and deeply question the truthfulness of data being presented. It might not be what you think it is.
### Power Settings
Power levels should be set correctly in a VNA for two reasons:
1. To not damage internal components which are costly to repair
2. To not compress the receivers used for signal measurements

Be sure to check the damage power levels in the manual of the VNA you are using because they vary depending on the make, model and options of the VNA test set. It is best to stay at least 6 dB away from damage power levels, and design your measurement system accordingly.

Apart from damage, the power level at the receivers should be restricted so that they operate linearly. Too much power will cause gain compression in the receivers and result in unwanted signal distortion that will lower your quality of measurements. It is often suggested by VNA manufacturers that the power level at receivers is -20 dBm or lower for sufficiently linear operation.

When measuring high gain amplifiers, the signal source may not provide sufficiently low power at the input so that the output level remains below -20dBm. For example, -70 dBm input power is needed for a 50 dB gain amplifier to produce -20 dBm at the output receiver. In such cases, most VNAs have input/output attenuators to reduce signal levels. A 30 dB input attenuator with a 10 dB output attenuator means that the signal source can be set at -30 dBm, which is quite a reasonable value. 

Put *example of measuring high gain amplifier*

The response of attenuator components will be removed during the calibration process. Hence it is important that calibration is performed using the same power settings that will be used for the measurement.
### Calibration Techniques
As we have seen so far, there are lots of internal components and cabling between the signal source and the DUT. **The contributions of unwanted components to the overall frequency response is removed by the process of calibration.** 

There are many calibration techniques available, each with their own pros and cons. All of them involve the measurement of a known set of devices called standards, whose electrical response is known a-priori. By measuring a set of these standards, unwanted contributions to the RF system are systematically removed.

The most popular calibration techniques are Short-Open-Load-Thru (SOLT) and Thru-Reflect-Line (TRL). There are a whole host of other options, but we will not cover all of them here.

These standards can be implemented in various mediums. For bench level measurements, coaxial standards are available as part of a calibration kit. More recently, instead of manually connecting each standard, an 'E-cal' kit is a multi-port device that can be connected to the VNA test terminals and the entire calibration performed by a single click of a button. For on-wafer measurements, these standards are implemented on an Impedance Standard Substrate (ISS). The measurement probes are placed on these standards to calibrate the VNA up to the tips of the probes.
### Practical guidelines

Lastly, but also most importantly, the handling of RF components is something that must be done with care. 

RF cables used to connect the DUT to the VNA are increasingly expensive depending on the frequency range they cover. They should be handled gently and not subject to mechanical stresses at any point in their lifetime. Semi-rigid cables should be bent into the proper shape using a shaping tool, and not changed after that. Continuous reshaping destroys semi-rigid cables. These cables can be 'subtly damaged' where DC connectivity still exists but RF signal transmission is degraded. Such systematic errors are hard to detect and debug.

Torque wrenches are essential in an RF laboratory. Cables must be attached to their connectors to the specified torque, usually about 8 pounds per square inch. The torque wrench used to tighten the cable should just able begin to break, and that's when you stop. Never let the torque wrench break fully.

A word of advice.

Take your time when making RF measurements. Proceed slowly and with intention. It is a meditative process with the need for great attention to detail. The universe will handsomely reward your patience with excellent RF measurements.
