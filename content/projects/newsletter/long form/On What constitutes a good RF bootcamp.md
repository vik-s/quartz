My honest opinion on the RF bootcamp workshop in IMS 2024. 👇🏼

Some people may not like this, but I'm going to say it.

This workshop has little useful content for a newcomer to the microwave industry especially while charging $130 - $250 dollars for a professional (non student). And, it's not included even in the SuperPass registration.

I've highlighted the parts I think are useful, but the session could be more focused on the fundamentals.

The intended audience is too broad - "technicians, new engineers, engineers wanting a refresh, college students, as well marketing and sales professionals." 

When you try to speak to everyone, you speak to no one.
