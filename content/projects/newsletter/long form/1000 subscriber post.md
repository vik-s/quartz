We did it! This newsletter has reached 1000 subscribers in the first month. I am more excited than words can describe and I express my deepest gratitude for joining me on this journey üôè. 

When I started the newsletter earlier this year, I did not know what to expect or how this experiment would go. The feedback from old friends, colleagues and the community so far has been only encouraging.

I figured I'd use this edition of the newsletter to explain a bit more of why I started this newsletter and what I have in mind for the future.

**Why I started a newsletter**

The last year, 2023, was one of turmoil for the tech industry with layoffs in most major tech companies. It occurred to me that if I were next, I would be dreadfully unprepared to interview.

I decided that I would spend some time preparing a little bit everyday to stay knowledgable and prepared. For learning resources, I had a few options:
1. Read textbooks (too terse)
2. Use my school notes (poorly maintained)
3. Watch YouTube videos (good option, but mostly academic and takes too long)

Using a combination of the above, I started putting together a few notes. Whenever I learn something, I like to explain it to myself, as if I were teaching it to my future uninformed self. I then write it down to the best of my ability. This closed-loop of understanding gives me great happiness - like I figured out a piece of a puzzle.

I soon realized that my notes would be helpful to a lot more people than just myself. If I did it right, it would provide bite-sized educational content that is not overly academic, that other engineers like myself can use for continuous learning. So should I start a blog? In this day and age, that would be a bad idea (link). Newsletters are much more effective (link), and delivers people with the content they signed up for, and could be a fourth option in the learning list above. 

So I decided to write one.

**What's with the name**

I tried. I really did. Every newsletter name I came up with sounded great at first, and then utter cringe the next day. The more I tried, the worse it got. Then I came across "Lenny's Newsletter" which is one of the biggest newsletters on substack, and figured if he could use his name, why not me? On an interview, Lenny also said that people spend too much time with name, logo, design and all the other stuff that doesn't matter instead of focussing on writing.

That's all the convincing I needed. I stopped trying to be witty and since a lot of my friends call me 'Vik', I just went with that. By not tying the newsletter name to a narrow niche, I keep my options open to experiment on topics. Win-Win.

**What do I plan to write about**
- write about basic engineering
- explain emerging industry trends
- focus on education, not the investing side

**Who is this for**


**Will this always be free?**
