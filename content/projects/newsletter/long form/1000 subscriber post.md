We did it! This newsletter has reached 1000 subscribers in the first month. I am more excited than words can describe and I express my deepest gratitude for joining me on this journey üôè. 

As a thank you, I have enabled "Subscriber Chat" that you can use to start threads, discuss or ask questions related to posts. You will receive a separate email on how to setup and use Substack's chat feature. I am excited for you to join the community!

When I started the newsletter earlier this year, I did not know what to expect or how this experiment would go. All the positive vibes and encouragement I've received so far is more than I could have hoped for.

In this newsletter, I'll explain why I started this newsletter, who my target audience is, and what I have in mind for the future.

**Why I started a newsletter**

The last year, 2023, was tumultuous for the tech industry with massive layoffs. It occurred to me that if I were next, I would be dreadfully unprepared to interview.

I decided that I would spend some time preparing a little bit everyday to stay prepared. My primary resources were textbooks (too terse), my school notes (poorly maintained) or YouTube videos (good option, but mostly academic and takes too long). I started putting together a few notes and soon realized that they would be helpful to a lot more people than just myself. 

If I did it right, it would provide bite-sized educational content that is not overly academic, that other engineers like myself can use for continuous learning. 

So should I start a blog? In this day and age, that would be a bad idea (link). Newsletters are much more effective (link), delivers content people signed up for, and is a viable resource for learning.

So I decided to write one.

**What's with the name**

I tried. I really did. Every newsletter name I came up with sounded great at first, and then utter cringe the next day. The more I tried, the worse it got. 

Then I came across "Lenny's Newsletter" which is one of the biggest tech newsletters on substack, and figured if he could use his name, why not me? I heard Lenny say that people spend too much time with the name, logo, design and other stuff that doesn't matter. The focus should be writing.

That hit home. I stopped trying to be witty and since a lot of my friends call me 'Vik', I just went with that. Also, by not tying the newsletter name to a narrow niche, I keep my options open to experiment on topics. Win-Win.

**What do I plan to write about**

My mission statement: Explain how communication technology works from an engineering point of view. 

Each weekly article will take less than 10 minutes to read and provide you value by:
1. saving you time in learning
2. leveling up your knowledge

Both of which I hope advances your career, keeps you motivated about engineering and prepared to interview on short notice.

My content is intended to be educational in nature and directed towards students, professionals or enthusiasts who want to understand the science and engineering behind the technology. I don't know if I'll venture into business aspects yet, and I'll definitely not provide investing advice.

The topics I choose will be centered around RF and microwave engineering which is what I know to a large extent. To push my boundaries and deliver a breadth of content, I'll explore other areas such as systems, communication standards, device technology, and other topics that I can learn and write about. Articles will range from informational to in-depth depending on the topic. I will, on occasion, write about career, productivity, and tips that I found useful.

If there is anything particular you want me to write about, do let me know! I'd love to hear from you, and humbly provide the best content I can to help you in your journey. You can reach me by replying to this email, or on social media (LinkedIn/X).

**Will this content always be free?**

At this moment, yes, it is 100% free. I will not charge until I can build up enough trust, demonstrate consistency and value, and know that I can do this long term.

From writing online for a month, I have learned that technical and accurate content is time consuming to produce. Each article takes me 10+ hours to research and write. Then there is social media, promotions, networking and growth aspects I need to put time into. It could easily be a full time job (and it is for many).

I'm hesitant to paywall content on this newsletter for two reasons:
1. Making educational content widely available is not possible. Paid subscription conversions 1-2% on Substack. Spending all that time writing, only to have 98% of the audience not read it, seems pointless to me.
2. Everyone has subscription fatigue. From the sheer number of subscriptions we need to decide on, everything from entertainment to software, I don't want to become yet another decision people need to make. 

To provide maximum access to everyone and still have the newsletter work as a side-hustle, here are a few ideas I have:
1. Sponsorship model: If the newsletter has enough readers, it would be a great candidate for companies to advertise. The readership demographic would be a targeted niche that might appeal to certain sponsors.
2. Low pricing: Price the newsletter low enough that it comes a no brainer for everyone to subscribe regardless of the purchasing power the reader has. The hope is that paid subscription conversion rates will be much higher. 
3. Pay what you want: If the content has helped the reader level up their career, or helped in their professional work even a single time, then the subscription would have paid for itself. If the employer provides a learning budget, then the subscription cost can be expensed (and should, because the company stands to benefit greatly). I can provide more perks at this tier, like access to a community, 1:1 access, and extended trial periods from sponsors' software.

Let me know your thoughts on this, if you would be a willing future subscriber, or if you have any other ideas. I'd greatly appreciate your inputs!

**What are my future plans?**

For a while, I will focus on delivering weekly content. I do have a full-time job and a family, and I don't want to over promise and under deliver. 

If I put together enough technical content over time, I will consider making self-paced online courses on topics that have the most interest. This will be a helpful resource if anybody wants to go through a topic in depth for either a project they are working on, or an interview they have to do.

I guess I'll just take it from there! No point building castles in the air.

Again, I thank you for being a newsletter subscriber and I hope you stay with me on this journey for a long time to come!
