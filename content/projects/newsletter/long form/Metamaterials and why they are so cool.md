Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that allow wave propagation in ways that do not occur in nature. For a propagating electromagnetic wave to seemingly defy the laws of nature has far reaching and fantastic consequences - invisibility cloaks, stealth aircraft, perfect lenses, (add more).

In this article, we will look at how metamaterials work, how they defy laws of nature and their amazing new applications.

Before we dive into metamaterials, we need to set the historical stage regarding the nature of wave propagation in homogenous media. A roundabout way of saying -- it's story time!

Scientists in the 19th century believed that there should be an invisible elastic, compressible, non gravitational solid called *luminiferous ether* that is ubiquitous in our universe through which an electromagnetic wave can propagate. The idea of an invisible medium makes common sense if you think of a rock thrown into still water. You see waves propagating outwards from the point of disturbance. Even sound waves travel through air vibrations. A good part of the century was spent on studying "ether mechanics" and the most prominent proponent of the idea was William Thomson/Lord Kelvin who dedicated his entire life to the properties of ether, [and wrote](https://online.ucpress.edu/hsns/article-abstract/doi/10.2307/27757305/47770/In-Defense-of-Ether-The-British-Response-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext):

> Ether of Space has been my life study. ... I always meant some day to write a scientific treatise about the Ether of Space; but when in my old age I came to write this book, I found that the Ether pervaded all my ideas, both of this world and the next. I could no longer keep my treatise within the proposed scientific confines; it escaped in every direction and now I find has grown into a comprehensive statement of my philosophy."

To detect the presence of ether, two scientists named Albert Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887 [devised an experiment](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/light/a-new-view-of-light). They built a device that split a beam of light in two, bounced off a mirror and arrived at a detector. If ether existed, then the speed of light would change depending on whether the light was moving in the direction of earth's motion or at right angles to it. They expected to see the beams of light arrive at different times at the detector. To their dismay, the beams of light arrived at exactly the same time proving that ether did not exist.
