Transmission lines are everywhere whether you realize it or not.

They are used to transport electrical signals over long distances like the high voltage lines that transport electricity to your home. Or they can be designed to carry high frequency signals over microscopic distances like in an integrated circuit.

Either way, having some transmission line fundamentals under your belt will prove useful if you are an electrical engineer. After reading this, you will be able to answer the following regarding Transmission Lines:

### Transmission line fundamentals

A transmission line is defined as:

> [!definiton]
Two or more conducting wires that carry an alternating electrical signal and are physically much larger than the wavelength of the signal.

The relative physical size compared to wavelength (also known as electrical size) is what prevents us from describing transmission lines as a simple circuit network. Due to electrical size, we need to represent transmission lines with a *distributed network* on a "per-unit-length" basis. 

We can associate resistance, inductance, capacitance, and conductance per-unit-length (R, L, G, C) for this transmission line. Now take a long transmission line and zoom in on a tiny segment of length - $\Delta z$ - and it's equivalent circuit representation is shown in Figure X. We will need this circuit in the next section to define some key parameters.

Before we get into it, here are several relevant kinds of transmission lines you should know about (add a pic showing each and list out their key parameter calculations as cheat sheet):

1. Coaxial - It has a center core conductor and a metallic shield separated by insulator. It is widely used in CATV distribution, internet access and radio communication equipment.
2. Microstrip - A planar structure that has a signal line over a single ground plane separated by a substrate dielectric.
3. Stripline - A planar structure whose signal line is surrounded by ground planes on *both* top and bottom, yet separated by substrate dielectrics.
4. Coplanar waveguide - A planar structure whose signal line is surrounded by ground planes on either side of it, and *at the same level*. Optionally, there can be a third ground plane below the signal line separated by a substrate dielectric.

### Key parameters defined

When you are dealing with transmission lines, you will need the terminology explained in this section to speak the jargon. My goal is to give you a short explanation of each key parameter of a transmission line with minimal math.

All of these parameters can be derived by solving Kirchoff's current and voltage equations for the circuit shown in figure X. The resulting equations are called **Telegrapher Equations** and I will specify what it is below, since it is so fundamental to transmission lines.

$$
\frac{dV(z)}{dz} = -(R+j\omega L)I(z)
$$
$$
\frac{dI(z)}{dz} = -(G+j\omega C)V(z)
$$
If the $RLGC$ parameters are known for the transmission line based on their physical structure, then several key properties can be calculated. The calculations for a co-axial line are shown in the figure.
#### Characteristic Impedance

Let's say you are holding one end of a transmission line which is infinitely long. You use a special meter (because a Radioshack (RIP) ohmmeter just won't do) to measure the impedance of the end of the line you are holding. The reading you see is called the Characteristic Impedance, represented by $Z_0$ and the value depends on the physical construction of the transmission line. This is what makes it a fundamental property for any given type of transmission line.

To keep it simple, assume that the line has no losses so that $R=G=0$. The formula to calculate characteristic impedance is:

$$
Z_0 = \sqrt\frac{L}{C}
$$
This simple formula gives us a way to understand how to design the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. 

- Higher inductance per unit length, higher the $Z_0$
	- On a planar transmission line, make the signal line thinner, you will increase $L$ and $Z_0$
- Higher capacitance per unit length, lower the $Z_0$
	- On a planar transmission line, move the ground closer to the signal, you will increase $C$ and lower $Z_0$.

If there are losses in the line, it does affect the characteristic impedance, but more importantly the signal will attenuate as it travels along the line due to dissipative losses.

#### Propagation constant

Its interesting that the telegrapher equations mentioned above can be wrangled into a wave propagation equation which we won't get into here (calculus is scary). Traveling electromagnetic waves in any medium have a quantity called *propagation constant* that describes how the wave travels in any given direction. It describes how fast the wave is and how it's amplitude varies as it travels.

Fortunately for us, the propagation constant represented by $\gamma$ is easily calculated from $RLGC$ parameters as follows,

$$
\gamma = \alpha + j\beta = \sqrt{(R+j\omega L)(G+j\omega C)}
$$
A few things of note:

1. Propagation constant is a function of frequency since $\omega = 2\pi f$, where $f$ is the frequency.
2. Propagation constant is a complex quantity where $\alpha$ is called the attenuation constant and $\beta$ is called the phase constant.

Attenuation constant $\alpha$ is expressed in Nepers per meter or decibels per meter (a Neper is about 8.7 decibels) and is a measure of how much of the signal energy is dissipated due to losses as it travels through the transmission line.

Phase constant $\beta$ is expressed in radians/meter or degrees/meter and is a measure of how much the phase of the signal changes per unit length as it travels through the transmission line.

If the phase changes by 360 degrees or 2$\pi$ radians, then the cycle has completed a full wave and the distance traveled by the wave is a *wavelength*. Then we calculate wavelength ($\lambda$) from the phase constant as,

$$
\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{\beta}
$$

#### Why is $Z_0 = 50 \Omega$ so common?

In microwave engineering, most systems are designed around a 50$\Omega$ impedance (and maybe an occasional 75$\Omega$.) This choice is rather arbitrary and was largely determined by transmission line dimensions that were easy to manufacture. Low (below 20$\Omega$) and high (above 100$\Omega$) characteristic impedance lines required spacings that were too narrow or too wide. Choosing something in between these two extremes was a reasonable choice, and it was the emergence of the test industry and companies like Hewlett Packard that sealed the deal on 50$\Omega$ as the standard.
