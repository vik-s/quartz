**Form-Factor**
In the last 10 years, there has been a steep rise of nanosatellites and small form-factor satellites called CubeSats that have been launched for connectivity, space research and military applications. CubeSats are small satellites confined to 1 cubic unit (1U) defined as 10cm x 10cm x 10cm (or 1 liter), and weighing typically about 1 kg. Over 4,000 such small satellites have been launched to date, with over 2,000 more expected to be launched before 2027.

In the words of Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator of NASA:

> "Just because a spacecraft is small, it doesnâ€™t make it easy. A highly constrained spacecraft can push the engineering, push the ingenuity of the team in a way that, in every way, is comparable to some of these big missions that weâ€™re doing."

These tiny but highly capable satellites have given access to space to universities and even countries without fully developed space programs. But due to the extremely constrained space, radio communications are a challenge to implement.
