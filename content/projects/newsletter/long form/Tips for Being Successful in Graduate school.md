## 5 Tips for Grad School


There's one thing that helped me a lot even before I started. I asked for **clear expectations** from my advisor on what would define the end of my PhD. This is something I see a lot of people not doing, or I'm not sure if this is something professors don't clarify. **How many journal and conference papers do I need to graduate?** This sets a clear intention on what is expected of you, and what the finish line looks like. Without this goal post, PhD programs tend to go on forever.

I can hear some readers say that's not always possible in all areas of engineering. Even getting one paper published in the Journal of Solid State Circuits or Nature, is achievement enough. I completely agree. If that is the nature of your field, then your advisor will set the correct expectation for you. Which is why it's important you ask.

### Set expectations

### Write as you go






Should I get a higher education?

Advice to do well at work
- I value people who want to always learn and be better, dont shy away from hard problems but instead attack it head on, work hard when needed but has a life outside too, be brutally honest in your work to say you dont understand, and generally great to be around.
