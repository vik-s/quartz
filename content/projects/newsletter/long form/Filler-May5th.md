Hey, I'm Vikram and thank you for reading.

It's been a week filled with work deadlines and I am traveling to Bangalore, India, at about the same time this edition goes live. Time has been short to write a deep technical article. I usually take my time to explain hard topics and draw figures to show ideas clearly. Instead of rushing an article with potential for error, I figured I'll write  about writing a newsletter. 

Pretty meta. Let's dig in.
## Newsletter as an educational medium

Much of RF engineering content is held within moats, and is accessible only through conventional mediums of education such as textbooks and universities. There are situations when these forms of media don't apply.
- You want to learn RF because you find it interesting and cannot justify the cost and commitment of an entire educational degree to learn it.
- You find the rigor of textbooks hard to comprehend and difficult to directly apply to engineering situations.
- You find the need to apply RF concepts at work due to a new project, but have not had a formal education in it.
- You would like to directly learn from somebody who has spent their career in it.

For all these cases, a weekly newsletter offers the option of delivering digestible pieces of technical content directly to the reader. Newsletter might imply actually writing about news, which I do not at the moment. Techletter is probably a better term.

The downside is that you may not exactly find what you are looking for. For example, I've been writing articles on RF systems but your need might be to learn signal integrity or power electronics. Even the field of RF is vast, and I won't have the knowledge to write about all of it.
Put *picture of EE domains*

This is a problem in any domain. The only solution is to have more people write such newsletters to cover the space of technical topics available.

YouTube is another possible medium, but most technical content is barely discoverable and drowns in the sea of other highly engaging videos. Also, you end up relying on Google's platform and monetization models instead of owning your audience. For a newsletter, this isn't a concern. If Substack shuts down, I still have the email list to continue this on my own.

## Content Workflow

I've had people tell me they are surprised how I can run a newsletter with a full-time job and a family to take care of. I'm aware I'm not the only one who does this. Substack has plenty of successful writers who do much more. But I'll explain how I go about it. 

### Topics
I don't overthink this. I just write whatever I am curious about that week, or have been thinking of. I write one off articles that are unconnected to anything. Or, I continue a thread of technical topics. I also discontinue threads, and pick them again later. The main idea is for me to stay interested and motivated. I don't want this to start feeling like a job (I've got one already.)

### Tools
Don't get me wrong. I love shiny software tools as much as the next guy. The right answer here is anything will do, but here is what I use.
- Text editor
	- Obsidian with AnuPpucchin theme https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin . I like the ability to link to different articles I write. It is free to use, and all documents stay local. This means I can write anywhere even without internet. The whole editor is snappy, and I much prefer this to Notion. I use YAML frontmatter to put metadata into each document I write. I then use the dataview plugin to automatically sort my articles based on topic and status.
- Images
	- I use the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian. I simple love the ease of use of this tool and can create pretty complicated diagrams easily. I also like the informal look at the generated diagrams, which gives it a different feel than a technical blog or textbook. I use Canva (free version) to generate thumbnails for Substack and  images for social media. In Canva, I have templates with the right image sizing for each platform. This makes it easy to duplicate it each time and create new images.
- Knowledge management
	- I use Zotero to store all the pdfs, and I read and highlight them in the same tool. It's fully featured and free to use. If your pdf collection grows, then Zotero offers paid cloud storage for a modest fee. But I store my collections on my own home server (yes, I am a nerd, I run my cloud infrastructure.) I also have a paid subscription to Readwise. I can quickly save webpages to it and use their reader to read and highligh those articles later. Both Zotero and Readwise have integration with Obsidian so that highlighted notes are directed imported into my writing tool.
