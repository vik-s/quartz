Radar has been used for many applications
- hand and finger gesture recognition
- touchless computer interaction
- vital sign monitoring

Choice of radar frequency depends on the available spectrum, and the nature of the application. For example, beyond 100 GHz, atmospheric loss limits it to short range applications - like high precision ranging for vibration detection, security imaging and gesture recognition.

Radar in healthcare is interesting. It is somehow used to measure heartbeat and respiration rates, and also arterial pulse. 

Industrial uses are interesting too. Tank level gauges, industrial safety and machine vibration monitoring. Radar can operate in darkness, dazzling light, dust or even high temperatures.

Some insane ranging applications:
- A FMCW 122.5 GHz radar sensor has 300um ranging precision in the range of 1-3um for a hydraulic measurement system.
- FMCW radar at 24 GHz for gauging water level at 3cm accuracy in the range of 1.5-9.5m. 
- UWB 80 GHz FMCW radar was used for ranging with better than 1um precision at 2m.

Google introduced the Soli radar which recognizes human gestures and interprets them with machine learning. It uses 60 GHz ISM band with 7 GHz bandwidth to identify objects to approximately 2cm range. It was introduced into the Google Pixel 4 but was ultimately abandoned due to issues of battery life and cost. It was also reported to have not worked very well. It was mysteriously removed from future versions of pixel.

Google recently launched the open standard Ripple in an attempt to boost radar tracking technology on non-Google devices.
