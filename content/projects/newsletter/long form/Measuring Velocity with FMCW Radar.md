## The Ambiguity Problem

In a previous newsletter, we looked at how frequency modulated "chirp" signals are used in FMCW radar systems. The transmitted chirp reflects off a target and is received after a time delay. Since the chirp signal has a continuously increasing frequency within the chirp period, there is always an instantaneous frequency difference between the transmitted and received chirps. 

These chirps are multiplied together in a mixer to generate a beat frequency, which is digitized by the ADC and processed in the digital domain. This beat frequency is proportional to the distance to the object.

The velocity of the target also manifests as a frequency shift in the received chirp due to Doppler effect. The simultaneous measurement of range and velocity results in an IF signal whose value cannot be solely attributed to range or velocity. There is now an ambiguity in the measurement since we cannot tell what contributed to the frequency shift.

In addition, we mentioned in passing that it is difficult to tell if an object is moving towards or away from the radar because received frequencies both above and below the transmitted signal frequency mixes down to the same IF (the image problem.)

Several astute readers pointed out that phase information can be used to further resolve targets.  This is what we will discuss in further detail in this article.

## Phase Information

The multiplicative mixing process between transmitted and received chirps not only results in a beat difference frequency, but the phase of the resulting IF is also the difference between the instantaneous phases of the transmitted and received signals. It turns out that this phase difference is immensely useful in velocity and even vibration measurements. We will see how.
