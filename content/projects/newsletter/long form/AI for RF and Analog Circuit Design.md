Historically, RF and analog circuit design has been an entirely manual process. It still is, compared to how much automation is possible in the digital world. A lot of the experience to do analog engineering comes from simply *doing* the engineering over and over. With time, we develop a "feel" for things and know what worked and what didn't from past experience. This intuition is the currency with which we build our engineering careers. We take pride in our intuition being irreplaceable. But is it?

The age of AI is upon us. The internet is rife with people and businesses trying to harness the power of AI to usher us into a new technological era. To what extent does AI possess the power of our intuition?

AI these days mostly refers to large language models (LLMs); the ability to process language input and produce human-like language output is most definitely a revolution of our times. While LLMs do have vast applications, it is not immediately apparent how this applies to electrical engineering work.

Aside from the race to implement silicon for LLMs, the excitement for engineering work comes from the generative nature of AI. **The prospect of simply "asking" the AI to design an electronic circuit and have it generate a fully working design that is more optimized than any human is capable of, is undeniably attractive.** The ability of image generation using tools like DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, and video generation using Sora, encourages us to imagine that we can generate chip layouts the same way. With sufficient hardware resources, years of human effort would be replaced by hours of machine resources. That's the utopian dream anyway.

For engineering work, optimization algorithms, machine learning techniques and neural networks have been the bread and butter for intelligent, automated design. The advent of LLMs has stirred up a new flurry of interest in these areas under the moniker of AI. The recent AI gold rush leads corporations to devote more resources to it, publications on AI to have more readership and EDA companies to claim their tools are assisted by AI. Everyone is looking for a piece of the AI pie.

In the rest of this article, we will go beyond the buzzword, especially as related to RF/analog design. Specifically, how recent research is minimizing the need for human intervention and creating new design techniques using machine-centric methods.

## Use in layout generation

While digital layout today is done using place and route, analog/RF layout is done manually by layout engineers making it a time consuming process which involves highly skilled engineers.¬†The complexity of layout involved is much higher to ensure layout symmetry, minimize losses and dispersion, and account for coupling effects and parasitics. 

Past attempts to automate analog layout generation have not stuck in industry. There are three major reasons why automated analog layout is relevant today:
1. Modern technologies like FinFET have highly restrictive design rules, which reduces the overall design space to be explored for layout generation.
2. There need for analog content is increasing and design iterations need to be minimized.
3. Advent of machine learning techniques provides new opportunities for solving the automated analog layout problem.

The latest approach to doing this is called [ALIGN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10682.pdf) (Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists). This is an [open-source](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public) automatic layout generation flow for analog circuits which translates an input SPICE netlist to an output GDSII layout, specific to a given technology. 

ALIGN attempts to build IC layouts much like a human would. This involves identifying  layout hierarchies, generating layouts of the building blocks and then assembling them at each level of the layout hierarchy. For example, the lowest level of hierarchy would be an individual transistor. They are used to generate primitives such as current mirrors and differential pairs, which are then assembled into modules such as transconductance amplifiers. Using these modules, the system such as an RF transceiver is built.

Another [open source project](https://github.com/magical-eda/MAGICAL) that attempts automatic analog layout generation is [MAGICAL](https://github.com/magical-eda/MAGICAL), which is described as "a human-intelligence inspired, fully- automated analog IC layout system" that is funded by the [DARPA IDEA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/intelligent-design-of-electronic-assets) program.

The overall flow is the same as ALIGN. Take an input netlist and generate an optimized layout. Interestingly, MAGICAL places emphasis in making sure that differential transistors are matched by identifying transistor sources that are connected to each other to form a virtual ground. The overall routing and placement is done based on a variety of optimization algorithms.

Publications using both these tools show that they are capable of producing designs that match in performance to a circuit designed by a human. This area of electronic tool development is certainly worth pursuing especially if it helps reduce design cycle times.

Recently, a startup company called [Astrus](https://www.future-of-computing.com/astrus-shaping-the-future-of-analog-chip-design-with-artificial-intelligence/) is looking at commercializing analog layout generation out of Toronta, Canada. Co-founded by Brad Moon and Zeyi Wang, they recently announced a $2.4M pre-seed funding round. Moon says that analog layout generation presents a very-specific, high value problem to the 60,000 or so analog designers globally. With increasing chip demand and shortage of highly skilled analog engineers, Astrus has a multi-billion dollar opportunity on their hands.
## Use in circuit design 

To translate a circuit specification into a working design layout, the circuit design phase needs to be automated as well, and not just layout generation from an optimized netlist. This is a much more complex problem that simply parametrizing a circuit netlist and throwing an optimizer at it. If you've ever tried this, you know it does not work. 

There are several reasons for this:
1. Pure optimization methods that randomly sample an initial space do not converge on many occasions.
2. If design specification changes, the optimization needs to restart from scratch.
3. Most approaches do not consider layout parasitics, which when included, can completely change the optimal design for analog circuits.

It‚Äôs not just analog layout that is an issue. Choosing optimal component values for an analog circuit is equally complicated and time consuming. Often, the design process heavily relies on the experience of the designer, and the number of possible iterations by a human is always limited.¬†**What if we can feed human intuition to a machine learning algorithm that can generate optimal designs?**

A 2020 paper from UC Berkeley describes a deep-learning based automated analog circuit designer called¬†[AutoCkt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01808.pdf). The paper claims that the algorithm intuitively understands the design space much like a human designer would, and converges on a working solution 40X faster than a genetic algorithm optimization. It uses¬†[Berkeley Analog Generator](https://bag3-readthedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a tool that simulates a circuit with layout parasitics, to design forty two-stage operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) that meet specification and pass¬†[LVS](https://www.viksnewsletter.com/p/a-beginners-guide-to-the-process?r=222kot&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)¬†using a single-core CPU in under three days. Not bad.

## Use in Electromagnetics

Another time consuming aspect of RF design involves the creation of optimum passive structures using electromagnetic simulation. We often look at matching circuits in a classical sense - a series inductor with a shunt capacitor, for example to convert the impedances from source to load. But what if these predetermined metal shapes or matching topologies are not the optimal answer?¬†

As Prof. Kaushik Sengupta says in¬†[a paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10136184/references#references)¬†(IEEE paywall) published in the Journal of Solid State Circuits,

> In the space of all possible manufacturable EM structures, there is no reason to believe that these (and therefore, the co-designed circuits) will be close to being ‚Äúglobally‚Äù optimal.

Prof. Sengupta and his team show that you can use deep convolutional neural networks to synthesize an arbitrary metal shape that provides the appropriate transformation of impedances. In¬†[this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zheng-Liu-108/publication/360427205_Deep_Learning-Enabled_Inverse_Design_of_30-94_GHz_P_sat3_dB_SiGe_PA_Supporting_Concurrent_Multiband_Operation_at_Multi-Gbs/links/62758ee6973bbb29cc67bce5/Deep-Learning-Enabled-Inverse-Design-of-30-94-GHz-P-sat-3-dB-SiGe-PA-Supporting-Concurrent-Multiband-Operation-at-Multi-Gb-s.pdf), an arbitrary metal shape serves as the output matching network for a millimeter-wave PA, and works as intended.

The ultimate RF/analog dream would be to utilize generative AI to completely synthesize a design from just specifications to a fully working, optimal design whose performance is unmatched by human iteratively running design simulations. Maybe we will get there at some point.
