Hardware engineering education is at a crossroads.

The learning curve is steep. Resources are virtually non-existent. You're stuck with expensive university education, or long-winded YouTube videos. Even worse, powerpoint presentations with no context. And very few online courses.

Today, we find ourselves at the throes of new hardware revolution with the dawn of the AI-age.

This Substack is an experiment on a new education modality.

Each weekly article will provide value in 10 minutes by:
1. Delivering deep technical content
2. Providing a collection of learning resources
3. Leveling up your knowledge a little bit every week

### Who is this for?

This publication is for you if:

1. You find hardware technology interesting, but don't want to pursue a university degree to learn it.
2. You find the rigor of textbooks hard to comprehend and difficult to directly apply to engineering situations.
3. You find the need to apply specific concepts at work due to a new project, but have not had a formal education in it.
4. You are about to interview, and need to review as many concepts as you can in a short span of time.
5. You would like to directly learn from somebody who has spent their career in engineering.

### Who am I?

My name is [Vikram Sekar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramsekar/). I currently work as a Senior Staff Device Modeling Engineer in Qualcomm. I have spent over 13 years working on and supporting all aspects of electronics modeling, design, simulation, and packaging, in a variety of companies ranging from small to large. I have a Ph. D in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I currently write this completely free publication as a part-time gig.
