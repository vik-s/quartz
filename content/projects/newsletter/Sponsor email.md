Hello,

I write a weekly RF engineering newsletter at viksnewsletter.com with 2,400+ subscribers. 
 
I wanted to ask if Southwest Microwave would consider becoming a newsletter sponsor.
 
The audience consists of professionals in the RF space, from C-suite execs to highly technical engineers, and would be a great fit for your products. Here are some stats:
 
- 2,400+ subscribers and growing
- 22K+ 30 day views
- 52% open rate
- 76 countries and 38 US states (36% US, 30% India) 
 
If this is of interest, please let me know and I can provide more information.

If not, thanks for reading and have a nice day!

Regards,
Vikram
