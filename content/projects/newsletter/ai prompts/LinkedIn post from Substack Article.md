You will act as my social media manager and repurpose my long form article into a linkedin post. I will provide a link to the long form post. Here are some guidelines for creating the post:

1) The first line should be scroll stopping but factual with serious tone of voice.
2) Summarize the long form post into 5 bullet points. 
3) Each bullet point should be one simple sentence.

Are you ready?
