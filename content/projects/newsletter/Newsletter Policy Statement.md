## What is your idea?

I want to create a top of the line Electrical Engineering Newsletter on Substack because none exists.

## How would your idea help?

The newsletter would a student or professional to continually keep their skills sharp by learning, and have an online resource to quickly prepare for an interview.

## Key questions each post must answer
1. ﻿﻿﻿What is the most important point?
2. ﻿﻿﻿Why is that the most important point? (what can you achieve with it)
3. ﻿﻿﻿Why should people care? (what's the benefit)
4. ﻿﻿﻿What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?
5. ﻿﻿﻿How do you want the reader to feel?
6. ﻿﻿﻿What should the reader do next?
