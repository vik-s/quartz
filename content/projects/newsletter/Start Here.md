Hey there 👋🏽!

Thank you for your interest in my newsletter.

Here is my pitch to convince you to subscribe.
> **Radio communication has brought humanity together in more ways than we imagined. This newsletter aims to help understand the magic behind the technology through deep technical articles, latest developments and historical perspectives.

Didn't work? Let's talk some more.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

My child points to an antenna and asks what it is. I told him that it creates invisible ripples that lets him watch cartoons. 
His eyes lit up in wonder. Yes, it is magic.

I'm still surprised that any of this actually works, and that this technology is in the hands of billions of people today. In this newsletter, I explore the engineering behind the technology in a fairly detailed manner. My aim is to help readers understand the fundamentals, stay abreast with the latest developments and explain the history of what got us to where we are.

To date, I have written 30 articles and nearly sixty thousand words, which is almost a full length book. The articles have been read over a hundred thousand times since the birth of this newsletter. **I publish on most Sunday afternoons, and each post will take about 10 minutes to read.** 

To date, **all my content is completely free**, and I earn nothing (other than the warm fuzzy feeling of helping others understand radio electronics) from this publication. I spend 10-15 hours per article doing the best I can to explain. 

If you're worried that the content might be too technical, **I use minimal jargon, simple language and few mathematical equations to get complex ideas across**. My goal is to be your friendly neighborhood co-worker who explains ideas in a way that is easy to understand. 

It would mean the world to me if you spend a few minutes reading any article that grabs your fancy, from this curated list.
