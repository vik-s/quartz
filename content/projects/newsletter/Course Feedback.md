It is not possible to escape Maxwell equations, Transmission line theory (Basically Pozar). However those who are not interested in mathematics, should have video tutorials to explain Maxwell equations, how these are to be digitised for simulation and their practical significance including matched boundary layers or computing domain /space. Same applies to Transmission lines , how these to be used as indusctor or capacitor or resonance circuit or bias line. Visual tutorials explaining these matter will be a great help for new comers as they can watch these at their own pace. . Companies can ask experienced mentors to prepare these with help from video editors.

I think biggest hurdle for beginners is not having intuitive understanding of electromagnetic waves. Gaining good practical knowledge on radio or high frequency signals helps to know whole system understanding.

Biggest challenge in rf and microwave to understanding of electromagnetic wave in depth more important to basics.

I think one of the hardest things is getting the fundamentals right. Cause if you go wrong there then things become way too hard when you learn advanced stuff. I would love it if you made a series of posts on RF Fundamentals

My biggest problem is finding where to start and how to check yourself along the way. I often get bogged down with all that I feel I need to learn and it gets tough to find a single path to learn through

I have background in analog design, I want dive into RFIC field but it is hard to know where to start (I just have some knowledge about electromagnetic field).

I think one of the best tools for learning RF is working in a lab. Learn to make accurate measurements manually with a network analyzer, spectrum analyzer, and signal generator. Unfortunately, many measurements these days are performed by automated software.
