1) **Introduction and Career Trajectory**
	1) RV College of Engineering
	2) MS + PhD at Texas A&M at Analog Mixed Signal Group
		1) PhD was focused on tunable MEMS filters and microwave based sensors. Totally took 4.5 years. Kamran Entesari - great advisor, his PhD program was very focused and I published 8 journal and 7 conference papers. It was a very productive PhD that helped me in career to get EB1 outstanding researcher approved for green card. A good graduate program has basically made my life.
		2) 1st job at pSemi in 2011. Hard job market. applied to 77 jobs, got 3 call backs, 2 on-site, 2 offers, accepted 1. it was a numbers game. I was focused on electromagnetics for RFIC.
		3) 2nd job at IDT. I made a lot of friends in pSemi and when some of the leadership opened up a satellite design center in san diego, they invited me to interview. I had a great time here. I was exposed to RF CMOS, SOI, BiCMOS, GaAs HBT and pHEMT. I also saw the design of wireless infrastructure products and even things like wireless charging. Great learning experience. 
		4) 3rd job at Qualcomm. I got the opportunity to work with a world class team where I was responsible for making the models for RF LNA designs in RFFE for cell phone. My models have been used in millions of LNA chips.
2) **Your PhD experience and how it shaped you? Your two cents for students confused between a PhD and a job.**  
	1) My PhD experience was tough. Like PhD programs are. It is more work than you can imagine. Its a learning experience I am proud of. I don't think it made me a super expert. It taught me how much I did not know, and gave me the confidence that I know how to learn. I still use that confidence to learn new things every day and write my newsletter at ViksNewsletter.com.
	2) PhD is not for everyone definitely. It is a challenging undertaking that can take a while, and it has its ups and down and you need mental toughness to see it through.
		1) One mistake a lot of people make: Set proper expectations with you PhD advisor as to what defines the finish line. When I asked Dr. Entesari, he said 3 journal papers in top journals and 2-3 conference papers in top conferences. This was a big ask, but at least now I know.
		2) PhD does open up doors to some jobs because of the kind of experience it gives you. I would say IC design is one of them. You need tapeout experience that is hard to get in a MS program. Access to silicon is hard and my first experience with TO was in a phd program. Of course there are exceptions.
		3) If you think PhD will help you earn more, then you'd be wrong. Sure it might be marginally more, but the lost earnings for years in a grad program has its opportunity cost.
		4) I strongly believe that PhD is worth it if it can be done in a reasonable time frame. When dragged out too long I have seen people regret doing it and they feel they should have taken a job instead.
  
3) **How to dabble into device modeling for college students? What kind of work can they expect as a device modeling engineer?**  
	1) The precursor to device modeling is to understand how semiconductor physics works. At a college level that is key to understand. Modeling can come later, and is much easier to learn once you know how transistors work fully.
	2) A lot of device modeling work happens at fabs. The process of extracting a model is fairly routine. Fabless companies sometimes have modeling teams to improve models in house or to validate accuracy.
  
4) **Advice to get into RF design?**  
	1) I have posted a lot of this on linkedin too. A strong understanding of fundamentals is needed. Know smith charts, transmission lines, amplifier design, basic electromagnetics. I have an  entire recommended topic list on one of my linkedin featured posts. 
	2) Also know how to use EDA tools. No one needs you to derive maxwell's equations but using a tool to deliver results puts you in the drivers seat.
	3) Think. Ask why. Learn. Iterate.
  
5) **If someone has a goal to settle abroad (probably Europe or US), how likely do you think it is for them to find a job abroad? Or would it be better to pursue a masterâ€™s abroad and then get into the job market.**
	1) Settling abroad is a hard question to answer because the immigration process is not straightforward. It's been a while since I went through it so I am not what the latest is on that scene. 
	2) Here is what I feel: For every 10 software engineers, there is 1 hardware engineer. For every 10 hardware engineers, there is 1 RF engineer.
	3) Become very good at what you do. Put in the hard work, be a good human being, be friendly and kind and you will rise to the top in any job market.
  
6) **Take on hardware startups**  
	1) I have not started one myself, but I'll take a guess from my dozen years of industry experience... it is hard and resource intensive. There is a lot of pressure to get things right in the first attempt as hard as that is. Because making hardware again is an expensive proposition. Getting it right first time is easier said than done... that doesnt happen always even in large companies with near infinite resources and tons of experienced engineers. It's just the nature of things.
	2) That being said, I dont want to discourage anyone from starting one. I in fact admire the tenacity of people who do.
7) **Promote your newsletter and blogs**
  
8) **How do you see the growth in the semiconductor industry going forward? Usually college students in India pick up software engineering there are plenty of jobs and they pay well. Do you think semiconductor jobs can take over software jobs in that context (more lucrative)?**
	1) Yes absolutely. Semi industry is a broad term, and there is as much semi demand as ever in the history of electronics. Just look at Nvidia, enough said. If you are asking about RF, then yes, lots of growth there too. ADAS systems are still growing, newer generations of comms will arrive, there is much work to do and new things to invent.
	2) Also lots of nations are placing emphasis on home grown semiconductors. But there are just not enough engineers who can make that happen, and sourcing the right talent is hard. So the future is bright for anyone who wants to go into Semi right now.
	3) Can it be more lucrative? Maybe... If there is tons of demand for the best in a small pool where is there is no supply, it can be lucrative.
