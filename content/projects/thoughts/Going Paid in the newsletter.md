### Will this content always be free?

**At this moment, yes, it is 100% free**. I will not consider going paid until I can build up enough trust, show consistency, provide value, and be ready to do this long term.

From writing online for a month, I have learned that technically accurate content is time consuming to produce. Each article takes me 10+ hours to research and write. Then there is social media, promotions, networking and growth aspects I need to put time into. It could easily be a full time job (and it is for many people).

I'm hesitant to paywall content on this newsletter for two reasons:

1. **I cannot make educational content widely available**. Paid subscription conversions are 1-2% on Substack. Spending all that time writing, only to have 98% of the audience not read it, seems pointless to me.
    
2. **Everyone has subscription fatigue**. From the sheer number of subscriptions we need to decide on, everything from entertainment to software, I don't want to become yet another decision people need to make. 
    

Let me know your thoughts or ideas on this. For now, I’ll keep writing.

To provide maximum access to everyone and still have the newsletter work as a side-hustle, here are a few ideas I have:

1. **Sponsorship model**: If the newsletter has enough readers, it would be a **great candidate for companies to advertise**. The readership demographic would be a targeted niche that might appeal to certain sponsors.
    
2. **Low pricing**: Price the newsletter low enough that it comes a **no brainer for everyone to subscribe** regardless of the purchasing power the reader has. The hope is that paid subscription conversion rates will be much higher. 
    
3. **Pay what you want**: If the content has helped the reader level up their career, or helped in their professional work even a single time, then the subscription would have paid for itself. **If the employer provides a learning budget, then the subscription cost can be expensed** (the company stands to benefit greatly). I can provide more perks at this tier, like exclusive access to a community, 1:1 access, and extended trial periods from sponsors' software.
