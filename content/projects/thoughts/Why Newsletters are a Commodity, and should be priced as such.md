- Netflix costs like $15, why should people pay that much for a newsletter.
- Most major publications sell subscriptions for a few dollars a month. Why should anyone pay that much for your substack?
- How many $15 subscriptions can a person pay for anyway? This is becoming like TV for nerds where we have to subscribe to every little channel to get the content we want.
- Can we form [[projects/thoughts/Why Newsletter Networks are a great idea|newsletter networks]]? Where paying so many $ will result in publication to a bunch of similar minded newsletters
- Instead what if I just charge $1? Paywall SEVERELY if not paying, but allow all content for just $1. Can I hit near 100% paid conversion rates and break substack?
- But I really dont need anywhere close to 100%. 10% will do. The math on this works out-
	- People like Lenny have >500K subs. Even if 10% of them sub for $1/mo, then he makes $50K/mo or $600K a year.
	- With 20K (4%, which is upper end EVEN for Lenny) paid subs at $15/mo, he makes 30K/month or $500K a year.
- So the math is really simple-
	- If I cut the price by 10 times, can I increase the subscription rate by 10 times?
	- Considering paid sub rates are already at 1%, maybe it's not too hard to get to Substack's promised land of 10%.
	- This should be doable especially if the content is very valuable.
	- So a $10/month newsletter getting 1% paid conversions, should make the same as a $1/mo newsletter getting 10% paid conversions.
	- And the fact that you are not paywalling the shit out of people means that your content is more "available" on the internet, and therefore is capable of providing more opportunities for business growth for you.
