- I wanted to provide people as much value as possible through my posts before I started charging people
- I want enough eyeballs on my content to establish myself as domain authority and build trust with the audience
- I need to demonstrate consistency (to the audience and myself) that I am capable of delivering a product on a schedule
- I want people to learn and be inspired from the content. Paywalling posts will drive people away from the substack. If my content starts attracting students mostly, not everybody has the ability to pay given purchasing power differences in various countries.
