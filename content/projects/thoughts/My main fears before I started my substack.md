It took me 2 months to overcome my fears and start my substack newsletter, and 1 month to hit 1000 subs. How I overcame my fears: üëáüèº

Fear 1: Consistency

Writing technical content takes >10 hours per post. I have a full time job and a family with kids. How will I find the time to deliver content on time?

I learned that I needed a system and a habit.
- Capture articles using Readwise, read/highlight, sync to Obsidian
- Use my golden hours from 4:30 - 6:30 am to write my content everyday
- Assign days of the week to research, writing, editing, and social media

Fear 2: Too niche content

I write specifically about communication technology. Will enough people care? After putting in all these hours, will people sign up?

Test the waters and find out the level of interest.
- Identify where people in my field hang out (mine is LinkedIn)
- Write content that delivers value on that platform (this is important)
- Announce that I am launching a newsletter and get pre-signups (I got 220)

Fear 3: Company confidentiality

I work in an industry where a lot of info is confidential. Will my employer object to my posting on social media?

Do due diligence and adjust content accordingly.
- Read company policy on what is allowed and what is not
- Designed my topics to avoid anything on the bleeding edge, or proprietary
- Use public information like papers and articles, and cite sour√∏ces

If you are considering starting one today, just do it. NOW!
