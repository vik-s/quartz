- Pg 3: When you mention antenna tuners ... actually the tuner is made up of a bunch of switches that connect inductors/capacitors in and out of the circuit to tune the antenna. It's not something found within antenna switches.
- Comments on the 5G growth cycle being dead:
	- On its own, 5G is not going anywhere and I agree with that. 6G adoption is likely years away, probably 2030, mm-Wave is DoA, and I think Chinese competition to western RFFE incumbents is likely going to rise and they will take over a larger piece of the pie. Your bearishness is warranted in my opinion.
	- However, with the rise of AI on edge devices which we have only begun to scrape, we will likely see a second wave of phone upgrades that includes new edge inference hardware from the likes of Apple and Qualcomm. While there may not be fresh RFFE content on these devices, there is likely a lot of money to still be made by western or Chinese companies on RFFE products. 
	- On the use of AI, a lot of companies are looking to use it to increase operational efficiency. I don't think a lot of people are looking at how to use the edge inference hardware available to make better RFFE products. That's where innovation and growth lies IMO.
- Comments on WiFi FEM / Auto RFFE
	- Wifi7 supports 16 spatial streams as opposed to 8 in wifi6. Wifi 7 might therefore need up to 16 WiFi FEMs?
	- WiFi 7 adoption has been slow and probably for good reason. The 6GHz band introduced in Wifi 6E already gives the wide bandwidth channels. WiFi 7 just builds on that with some added features. I'm sure future smartphones will have WiFi 7, but the adoption in routers etc might still be slow. The need for WiFi 7 will only be in low latency use cases like wireless AR/VR or in high density enterprise scenarios. I'm still bearish on WiFi 7 driving significant revenue.
	-  I have a detailed article on WiFi 7 if you are interested in linking it (put link)
	- Automotive RFFE however I'm much more optimistic about. Adoption of ADAS is still possible in many vehicles, and companies offering retro-fitting of ADAS will have the same success as car stereo makers in the 1990s. I have a sequence of articles on Automotive radar too. I plug those below.

- Comments on revenue numbers
	- I cannot confirm nor deny any revenue estimates about Qualcomm RFFE since I am under a company confidentiality agreement. I haven't researched the filings of all these other companies either. So we're good here because I'm not in the know :)

What about Piezoelectric On Insulator technology?
