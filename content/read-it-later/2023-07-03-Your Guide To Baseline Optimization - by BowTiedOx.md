## Highlights

> While I am a huge believer in the philosophy of being the best version of ourselves we can be and optimizing our bodies and minds, there comes a certain point where it becomes too much and simply isn’t realistic for anyone with any semblance of a normal life. Not to mention, these “benefits” are typically negligible in the big picture and have a very diminishing return. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-guide-to-baseline-optimization-by-bow-tied-ox-1891e13fbb9#9ebfd82d-3d6f-4232-b3d1-5acb0b5d6397)

> don’t put all your time and effort into focusing and doing the minor/small things instead of the major/big things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-guide-to-baseline-optimization-by-bow-tied-ox-1891e13fbb9#85162db3-5e94-499c-bb5b-270aa8c79510)

> Your goals and personal needs will determine how much, but my general recommendation is **3-5 days of lifting/resistance exercise a week** for:

1. The sweet spot, especially for most muscle-building and general health goals
2. Efficient—could do more but going to see diminishing returns on the benefits [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-guide-to-baseline-optimization-by-bow-tied-ox-1891e13fbb9#d49c2f8f-66a0-41bf-8836-cc7521b06d21)

> I will say my recommendation is incorporating **zone 2 cardio at least 3 times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes** if solely looking for the general fitness and mental benefits, **up to 4-6 days a week for 45-75 minutes** if looking for more longevity and cardiovascular disease prevention [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-guide-to-baseline-optimization-by-bow-tied-ox-1891e13fbb9#654d5d62-c36a-4c40-8620-9743dbafbc20)

> We could talk about diet all day and its role in optimizing nearly all parts of existence because at the end of the day, _it is literally the main driver of nearly all outcomes of health_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-guide-to-baseline-optimization-by-bow-tied-ox-1891e13fbb9#8b5de96b-21e9-4083-9e8c-2af6263c095f)
