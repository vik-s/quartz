## Highlights

> Many of us can relate to this experience when we spend enough time in the metropolis: it sucks all the energy out of us. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#cb6a981d-781e-4296-8b72-11189c3d6d28)

> German sociologist Georg Simmel rightly called metropolitan life an intensification of nervous stimulation. For the brain not to lose its marbles against this intensity, people must make rapid decisions with their heads instead of their hearts. As Simmel wrote beautifully in the paper Metropolis and Mental Life: 
“The reaction to metropolitan phenomena is shifted to that organ which is least sensitive and quite remote from the depth of the personality.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#d0ce5f0d-c2a9-4371-867f-2b13910acd57)

> There’s no heart in the metropolis, only a bunch of floating heads calculating their next moves. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#be88731d-b55f-4aef-8e3a-72bc7b53c983)

> A direct consequence of this metropolitan over-stimulation is something called the blasé attitude. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#1cad3060-791d-4d52-9a01-c0b933e9f729)

> Simmel considered the blasé attitude a byproduct of overstimulation from metropolitan life. A million things are happening in the city, and all the stimulations tend to “agitate the nerves to their strongest reactivity for such a long time that they finally cease to react at all.” When we spend enough time in the city, we will reach a point where we’d stop caring about anything.

> And by trying our best to act deliberately against the chaotic currents, we may secure a patch of peace in our hyper-productive culture. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-city-life-makes-us-grumpy-by-robin-waldun-18732cacc4c#9feda5db-ab47-4a78-b4bd-ce2a767ff6ef)

> So go to a park, visit your aunt in the suburbs or meditate for five minutes in the morning. The enemy isn’t the rude city folks. Instead, it’s the undercurrent of our unsustainable pace that makes us so intolerable to one another.
