## Highlights

> There’s a legendary tale about an artist named Zhu Da (who lived in 17th century China) that would start his paintings in the following way:
 ​
 (1) Lay out a big, blank canvas,
 ​
 (2) Take out an incredible amount of alcohol,
 ​
 (3) Get very drunk,
 ​
 (4) Appreciate the incredible ponytail he’s grown with his hair, then dip it into a bucket of ink,
 ​
 (5) Create a series of swishes on the canvas with said ponytail,
 ​
 (6) Pass out.
 \​
 After completing these 6 steps and waking up the next morning, Zhu Da would then take a good look at the swishes he created. He would study the texture of them, and unearth the various places within the swishes where patterns may secretly reside. And once he discovered the image that emerged as a result of connecting these patterns, he filled in the gaps with intentional brushstrokes that would form the beautiful landscapes he was famous for painting.

> I make it a point to start these essays with no outline or no pre-existing conceptions of what I want to write. I simply sit down, set a timer, and just let whatever I want to delve into come about. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#a0676757-876d-4f12-8017-4e5150533fa5)

> get in the habit of journaling with zero intention to publish. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#547776a3-3d5d-45d2-afa5-4c3ed88ea939)

> you’ll see how many of the ideas you published in another format were birthed as informal musings in a more private realm. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#3eaf62d8-e9b4-419c-a885-65f1394c9cf3)

> Once the blob has been created and he wakes up the next day, Zhu Da is sober and ready to focus on his work. The first thing he does is to examine the result of the randomness that he’s made, and then to actively examine it according to his unique perspective. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#4d408bd1-711a-4f09-a441-e60ef810d492)

> originality actually stems from something deeper: the ability to see beauty in what most people often overlook [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#3eba00f8-1686-4eb7-b7d9-ad0ebe991449)

> Leonardo da Vinci famously stared at dirty city walls until he was able to see the patterns that would inspire him to create his art. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#f5370016-930a-444a-8a40-3cfb098aa0f0)

> You don’t judge yourself for what you’re making, and you’re not questioning the way you’re putting things together. You’re just doing what you’re there to do, and accepting the process each step of the way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/frictionless-creativity-1872fd03af2#f0bb6c02-4344-4fa5-bbec-14c645cffa7a)

> The reason why creativity is one of the great virtues of humankind is that it’s the purest form of self-acceptance. With each thing you create, you’re casting a vote for your unique perspective, and signal that you embrace it. You understand that beauty isn’t defined by the rigidity of a collective norm, but by the fluidity of interpretation that is localized to each individual mind.
