## Highlights

> The decisions and health choices you make today not only directly impact your own genetic code, but that of your future offspring, AND EVEN future generations. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#cebdb358-e0d9-461e-9e65-fabaa3b70e9e)

> “Epigenetics is the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#f0b76c52-85da-42a3-b8bf-e8caed4f0bc0)

> This effect is so profound that scientists have even found epigenetic memory passed down 14 generations [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#75d091d3-722e-4c1a-b8fb-ce52bb637e97)

> This is a HUGE responsibility and one that too many take extremely lightly. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#164959a7-ca00-4b51-adf9-c281dcc467d0)

> “What’s on the inside matters most” is pretty accurate. Sure, we all want an attractive counterpart, but we also want someone with spectacular genetic health. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#e55830e4-8529-4201-afcd-48b9cb79c5c6)

> Realistically your body (your wife’s body) needs about 2-3 years of preparation for any meaningful effects to occur. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#59d05d51-0a4f-4535-bd07-d3bda9b48205)

> This is because the mother needs to give herself ample time for her body to build itself up with all the necessary nutrients for childbearing—and fully replenish itself for every child after the first, otherwise child number two and so forth may not be as healthy as their eldest sibling. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#2e178262-c8b4-49b3-bbeb-991d5a517de5)

> So how exactly does what food you consume matter when it comes to your kid? Genetic momentum. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#41a89083-a62e-4010-9777-5048b0a9b586)

> What you consume can and will change your DNA. Certain foods can break down your genes just like certain foods can rebuild and repair your genes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/epigenetics-how-to-create-generational-health-1873b67ca1a#4d1b4ed4-f5ba-4f5d-9e78-18dde75f47e1)

> Our cells are extremely sensitive to the specific nature of the chemical messages we send them every time we eat. By altering the blends of nutrients (or toxins) in our food, we can actually control whether our cells function normally, or convert to fat, or turn cancerous.
