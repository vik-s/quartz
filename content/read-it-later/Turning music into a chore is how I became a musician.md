## Highlights
* improve my technique, by sheer virtue of having 10 hours a day to focus and watch tutorials.
* The real change however was turning music making from a hit or miss hobby into a repeatable, boring, "professional" routine.
* I was not only trying to make as many songs as possible, under the nagging time pressure of my sabbatical slipping away like sand; I also started working with other musicians.
* I had found a couple of small online techno producer communities
* jam on synths, record,
* clean up recordings, cut out interesting passages,
* make different grooves,
* layer grooves and synth lines to sketch out song ideas,
* lay out song arrangements,
* refine arrangements,
* do a mixdown,
* do a second pass
* Most often, it was impossible to judge the quality of the session in the immediate aftermath.
* put in the hours, switch when a task becomes stale and frustrating, and always (always!) file away the results so that they can be quickly recalled later.
* If no task is appealing, take a break and go for a bike ride.
* (I switched to a correct horse battery staple naming scheme
* How musically valuable a certain idea was only became apparent over time, and in context.
* There was no emotion attached to them anymore: they were just one file amongst many others.
* I knew that even if something wasn't good enough, I could just put in the hours and come up with new material. It wasn't a matter of inspiration or luck or serendipity anymore.
* no correlation (or indeed, if there is, it is a negative correlation) between how satisfying a session felt and how interesting the resulting material was.
* You have to get numb before you get good.
* Had I continued to make a song here and there, over the weekend, I would have never discovered that making music is boring â€“ I had to pretend being a working musician to get to that point. I had to fake it to make it.
