## Highlights

A structure would make writing the [[newsletter]] easier as I could work within the constraints of the headings to guide what I wrote about. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-simple-format-to-distil-what-you-learn-186d10c28a7#92983eae-6aaa-4ba5-91c7-927cc1ca217c)

Here's the ICE format (Source):
- OBSERVATION - When I notice something interesting, I use this tag to make a note of it. It is like using a keyword as a highlight.
- INSIGHT - What is an insight about this observation? Also you can have multiple insights from one observation.
- CONCEPT - What are some ideas for how this insight could be put to use? You can also have multiple concepts from one insight.
- EXECUTION - What specific steps can you take to execute on the concept? This becomes a list of specific tasks you can do in support of your projects and concepts. You can also have multiple executions from a single concept, or by combining concepts.

Since adopting this format I've found my desire and ability to write have improved. I'm encouraged to explore things I'm genuinely curious about. This in turn translates to how much and how easily I can write about those topics.

I'm learning a lot more and taking more information in whereas before it would have been in one ear and out the other. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-simple-format-to-distil-what-you-learn-186d10c28a7#85f23879-72c0-48a0-8822-ef639238b1c8)

If you're thinking about starting a newsletter of your own or simply starting a blog, I'd encourage you to "steal" this format and conduct your own learning experiments. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-simple-format-to-distil-what-you-learn-186d10c28a7#b244bfbe-eeca-457e-9cd5-9bb789b5f833)
