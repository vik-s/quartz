## Highlights

> Kierkegaard lived like a hermit and only allowed himself to speak to someone during his “people baths”. Michel de Montaigne liked the company of classical authors in his stone tower better than the quacking mobs in town. And even someone like Theodore Roosevelt, who was naturally gregarious and outgoing, disappeared into the library for long periods before he resumed his social life at Harvard. These long periods of attention and isolation were not eccentric quirks but indispensable to these thinkers.

> Attention, at least in schools, branded itself as “following every step of the instructions", and knowledge is the final answer if we conform to the steps. After nearly a decade of this kind of learning, we’ve domesticated ourselves into “answer-finding machines” instead of curious thinkers.

> with all the information available through our phones  constantly supplying us with answers, there’s virtually no room to think for ourselves. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-cultivate-attention-in-our-distracted-world-1874aafe2b7#7e2275c7-d52a-4ab2-b4f9-dc2d56431568)

> During the 19th Century, Parisian streets were littered with newsprints. People read newspapers on the train, at cafés and in front of stores. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-cultivate-attention-in-our-distracted-world-1874aafe2b7#59b3eac5-84f0-4bd7-9d6f-f15542614abc)

> But the 19th-century novelist Gustav Flaubert saw these “readers” in a very different light. Le Journal, for Flaubert, promoted a new kind of stupidity he called: La Bêtise. The idiot, with the power of mass media on his side, can get to the cutting edge of science, literature and philosophy, but he is still an idiot. He knows a lot without understanding because he never bothered to engage knowledge with sustained attention.

> Instead of worrying about reading everything under the sun, pick a few quality sources and apply sustained attention, allowing the lessons to transform your mind gradually.

> In this post, we’ve only covered attention in terms of learning, but there’s more to the idea. In friendships, for example, attention allows us to put aside our prejudice and face a person as they are. In politics, attention lets us observe events with distance and judgements instead of leaping to our first impulse to get into a shouting match. In our personal lives, deliberate practices like meditation free us from the chaos of our minds. To put it simply, attention is the act of being human and a defence of ethics.
