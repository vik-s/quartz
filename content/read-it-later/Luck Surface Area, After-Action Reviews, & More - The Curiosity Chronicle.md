## Highlights

> The luckiest people have a massive luck surface area. They expose themselves to more luck than the average human.
Two keys to increase the size of yours:
Remove the "black holes" that shrink your luck surface area. Cut the people and actions out of your life that are "anti-luck" and you'll immediately expose yourself to more chance positive encounters.
Take deliberate actions that expand your luck surface area. It's hard to get lucky watching TV at home alone, but it's much easier to get lucky when you're out engaging with smart, interesting people.

A few of my favorite simple luck surface area expanding actions:
Send one cold email or DM per day. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Spend more time around optimists. Pessimists sound smart, optimists tend to get lucky.
Share your thoughts publicly. Write and share, build and share.
Build free time and boredom into your schedule. Free time is where your thoughts and ideas mingle. When you have free time, you have the headspace and bandwidth to take on potential non-linear opportunities.
Always remember the Luck Razor: When choosing between two paths, choose the path that has a larger luck surface area. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/luck-surface-area-after-action-reviews-more-the-curiosity-chroni-1873ad3956c#77c30eb0-8470-44ad-a67f-c16dfe7ddfce)

> The After-Action Review (AAR) is a simple, powerful framework used by the military and leading corporations to make continuous improvements by reflecting on each completed action and distilling the relevant insights to inform future actions.
The AAR is grounded in four key questions:
What did we intend to accomplish?
What did we accomplish relative to our intention?
Why did it happen this way?
What will we do to adapt and refine for an improved outcome?
It is typically conducted after a major project or action to assess the performance of an individual or team and make adjustments necessary in advance of the next one.
