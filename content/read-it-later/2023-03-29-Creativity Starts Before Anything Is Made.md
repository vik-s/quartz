## Highlights

> What was the point of quitting my job to do this, when I’m not spending 8 hours each day on it? I should have just kept my job and reserved this for the evenings like before. At this rate, I would be spending the same amount of hours on my creative work in both scenarios anyway… [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#b6f431f2-1e05-4282-a03f-ca8d69df05e8)

When we spend our days trying to force creativity out, and nothing happens, we start to become hesitant to commit our entire lives to creativity. When will it strike?

Instead having a day job is much more consistent in the work output regarding, compared to a creative endeavor.

> **creating things is just a small part of what Creativity is all about**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#51ad3bf1-8977-4528-9677-db42ba514843)

> Creativity is always in the background, observing what he’s doing and taking note of everything that’s going on. Whether it arrives in the form of experience or knowledge, Creativity is there to document whatever is happening at various times. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#e0dff22a-20d3-41c6-96f9-ab2a17fbfd56)

> We tend to believe that the act of creating is what defines creativity, but creativity starts long before anything is made. The first word you write is a distillation of the knowledge you’ve accumulated over time. The first brushstroke you paint is a reimagining of the experiences you’ve stored somewhere in the mind.

> Creativity can be regularly cultivated, but it cannot be mechanized. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#2778a840-e0d8-4b28-ac20-a685baee2448)

> Using a 40-hour workweek to measure creativity is like using a 12-inch ruler to measure happiness. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#c85255da-5966-40e1-952a-7fc7f4297d0a)

> There is a fundamental mismatch between what the tool is designed to measure, and the object of measurement itself. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-creativity-starts-before-anything-is-made-187309db831#9f57a099-2480-4ae3-928d-23b7c2e1ade8)
