## Highlights

> So to embody the identity of a creator, you have to look beyond the grand vision, and delve into the small building blocks that comprise it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#e6b55c79-6338-4aac-a111-b25554295387)

> you spend just one hour creating something, you’re ahead of most people out there. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#e04aeb51-5527-4ff8-aef3-33d3fe4b0873)

> How do you ensure that you get the most out of each hour?
The easy answer is to optimize that hour for flow states. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#1de1d055-ebee-4141-936d-1c8e1bc39533)

> To ensure that you’re in a setting where you can be fully absorbed in what you’re creating, and to have that be the sole character in your theater of attention. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#227d1731-1082-4509-867b-b10349305ac0)

> flow states need time to emerge. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#3dda7681-936b-4789-a6c8-5a3b5aecc59f)

> (1) Eliminate all distractions. The key to staying on that difficult on-ramp is to remove anything that allures you away from it. You’ll need sustained focus to power you through the moments where you feel like pivoting your attention to something easier. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#5782f2b3-8720-4490-bdd2-d74caae415f5)

> Walk around if you’re feeling stuck. If you tend to sit or stand in one place when you create (like I do), then getting the body in motion is a great way to get the mind moving. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#efd9b903-c560-4481-83b3-cee713e9b771)

> (3) Get something out, even if it feels like gibberish. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-moretothat-com-create-for-just-one-hour-each-day-187309537a4#bb6d9ffe-91af-4285-960c-1cfaa40bbee7)

> The commitment to starting is the force that propels you throughout the entire work. New connections build on top of old ones, and slowly but surely, a web of ideas that were previously hidden from view begin to emerge.
