Feb 1, 2024</p><ul class=tags><li><a href=https://notes.vsekar.com/tags/misc_letters/>Misc letters</a></li></ul><p>We did it! This newsletter has reached 1000 subscribers in the first month. I am more excited than words can describe and I express my deepest gratitude for joining me on this journey 🙏.</p><p>As a thank you, I have enabled &ldquo;Subscriber Chat&rdquo; that you can use to start threads, discuss or ask questions related to posts. You will receive a separate email on how to setup and use Substack&rsquo;s chat feature. I am excited for you to join the community!</p><p>When I started the newsletter earlier this year, I did not know what to expect or how this experiment would go. All the positive vibes and encouragement I&rsquo;ve received so far is more than I could have hoped for.</p><p>In this newsletter, I&rsquo;ll explain why I started this newsletter, who my target audience is, and what I have in mind for the future.</p><p><strong>Why I started a newsletter</strong></p><p>The last year, 2023, was tumultuous for the tech industry with massive layoffs. It occurred to me that if I were next, I would be dreadfully unprepared to interview.</p><p>I decided that I would spend some time preparing a little bit everyday to stay prepared. My primary resources were textbooks (too terse), my school notes (poorly maintained) or YouTube videos (good option, but mostly academic and takes too long). I started putting together a few notes and soon realized that they would be helpful to a lot more people than just myself.</p><p>If I did it right, it would provide bite-sized educational content that is not overly academic, that other engineers like myself can use for continuous learning.</p><p>So should I start a blog? In this day and age, that would be a bad idea (link). Newsletters are much more effective (link), delivers content people signed up for, and is a viable resource for learning.</p><p>So I decided to write one.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s with the name</strong></p><p>I tried. I really did. Every newsletter name I came up with sounded great at first, and then utter cringe the next day. The more I tried, the worse it got.</p><p>Then I came across &ldquo;Lenny&rsquo;s Newsletter&rdquo; which is one of the biggest tech newsletters on substack, and figured if he could use his name, why not me? I heard Lenny say that people spend too much time with the name, logo, design and other stuff that doesn&rsquo;t matter. The focus should be writing.</p><p>That hit home. I stopped trying to be witty and since a lot of my friends call me &lsquo;Vik&rsquo;, I just went with that. Also, by not tying the newsletter name to a narrow niche, I keep my options open to experiment on topics. Win-Win.</p><p><strong>What do I plan to write about</strong></p><p>My mission statement: Explain how communication technology works from an engineering point of view.</p><p>Each weekly article will take less than 10 minutes to read and provide you value by:</p><ol><li>saving you time in learning</li><li>leveling up your knowledge</li></ol><p>Both of which I hope advances your career, keeps you motivated about engineering and prepared to interview on short notice.</p><p>My content is intended to be educational in nature and directed towards students, professionals or enthusiasts who want to understand the science and engineering behind the technology. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll venture into business aspects yet, and I&rsquo;ll definitely not provide investing advice.</p><p>The topics I choose will be centered around RF and microwave engineering which is what I know to a large extent. To push my boundaries and deliver a breadth of content, I&rsquo;ll explore other areas such as systems, communication standards, device technology, and other topics that I can learn and write about. Articles will range from informational to in-depth depending on the topic. I will, on occasion, write about career, productivity, and tips that I found useful.</p><p>If there is anything particular you want me to write about, do let me know! I&rsquo;d love to hear from you, and humbly provide the best content I can to help you in your journey. You can reach me by replying to this email, or on social media (LinkedIn/X).</p><p><strong>Will this content always be free?</strong></p><p>At this moment, yes, it is 100% free. I will not charge until I can build up enough trust, demonstrate consistency and value, and know that I can do this long term.</p><p>From writing online for a month, I have learned that technical and accurate content is time consuming to produce. Each article takes me 10+ hours to research and write. Then there is social media, promotions, networking and growth aspects I need to put time into. It could easily be a full time job (and it is for many).</p><p>I&rsquo;m hesitant to paywall content on this newsletter for two reasons:</p><ol><li>Making educational content widely available is not possible. Paid subscription conversions 1-2% on Substack. Spending all that time writing, only to have 98% of the audience not read it, seems pointless to me.</li><li>Everyone has subscription fatigue. From the sheer number of subscriptions we need to decide on, everything from entertainment to software, I don&rsquo;t want to become yet another decision people need to make.</li></ol><p>To provide maximum access to everyone and still have the newsletter work as a side-hustle, here are a few ideas I have:</p><ol><li>Sponsorship model: If the newsletter has enough readers, it would be a great candidate for companies to advertise. The readership demographic would be a targeted niche that might appeal to certain sponsors.</li><li>Low pricing: Price the newsletter low enough that it comes a no brainer for everyone to subscribe regardless of the purchasing power the reader has. The hope is that paid subscription conversion rates will be much higher.</li><li>Pay what you want: If the content has helped the reader level up their career, or helped in their professional work even a single time, then the subscription would have paid for itself. If the employer provides a learning budget, then the subscription cost can be expensed (and should, because the company stands to benefit greatly). I can provide more perks at this tier, like access to a community, 1:1 access, and extended trial periods from sponsors&rsquo; software.</li></ol><p>Let me know your thoughts on this, if you would be a willing future subscriber, or if you have any other ideas. I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate your inputs!</p><p><strong>What are my future plans?</strong></p><p>For a while, I will focus on delivering weekly content. I do have a full-time job and a family, and I don&rsquo;t want to over promise and under deliver.</p><p>If I put together enough technical content over time, I will consider making self-paced online courses on topics that have the most interest. This will be a helpful resource if anybody wants to go through a topic in depth for either a project they are working on, or an interview they have to do.</p><p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just take it from there! No point building castles in the air.</p><p>Again, I thank you for being a newsletter subscriber and I hope you stay with me on this journey for a long time to come!</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://notes.vsekar.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Vikram Sekar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://notes.vsekar.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vikramskr>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vik-s>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
