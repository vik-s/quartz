Mar 22, 2023</p><ul class=tags></ul><p>Money compounds when invested properly but time is a continuously depleted resource. We cant store it, we can&rsquo;t compound it. It&rsquo;s use it or lose it. What if you can spend money to protect your time? Instead, use your time to learn something new, exercise, build relationships, relax - the possibilites are endless. Apart from time, there are more reasons why you should not do everything yourself.</p><ul><li>some things need an expert to get done properly</li><li>it may be beyond your current physical ability</li><li>you just don&rsquo;t enjoy doing it</li><li>you may risk hurting yourself</li></ul><p>In this video, we&rsquo;ll talk about 10 ways in which you can buy back your time with money.</p><ul><li>Housecleaning<ul><li>For the longest time, I was resisting getting help on this one and did everything myself. I told myself that I am not that busy or that entitled to clean up after myself, then I convinced myself that no cleaner can match my OCD-infused levels of ultra-cleanliness that I expect when I pay hard earned money to someone.</li><li>As it turns out none of this is true. I finally came around to admitting that I needed the help given that we have children and two full time jobs, and that cleaners are super professional at what they do and generally do a good job. Additionally, not only do i not spend the time cleaning, I don&rsquo;t spend time recovering energy from my cleaning work. This was a double win for me.</li><li>House cleaning services typically run $20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. You can get quotes from cleaning companies in your area. If you&rsquo;ve never got your housed professionally cleaned before, they might insist that you get a deep cleaning first - which can run you about $300-$400. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty and how much you want to spend on the service. Or, you can even get just deep cleanings done once in a few months, where things like blinds, fans and refridgerators get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about $200-$500 depending on the size of your house.</li><li>This might be too expensive for some people, that&rsquo;s totally understandable. In that case, get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a EuFY or Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won&rsquo;t weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit. However this is just the floors, you will still have to do the kitchen countertops and bathrooms yourself.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Running the vacuum cleaner around the house</li><li>Wiping a countertop</li><li>Dusting some surfaces with a mask on.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Cooking<ul><li>We need to eat everyday, and what we eat matters to our health. Eating out, while making the healthiest food choices can definitely save you time, good quality food, even if readily available around you, can be very expensive over the long term. I do have friends who argue that the overhead of buying groceries, preparing food, dealing with the ensuing kitchen clean up, etc, is simply not for them, and the expense of eating out is totally worth it.</li><li>An alternative to eating out all the time is to have pre-prepared meal kits delivered at your doorstep, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to prepare your meals. There are companies such as Hello Fresh, or Fresh n Lean that ship to your door step, and you get a variety of diet choices like vegan, paleo, keto. The cost per serving is typically between $10-$20, and while this calculus might work out for some people, it is simply not an option for those with larger families.</li><li>Another option is to get Pre-prepared meals from places like Costco or similar grocery stores, where you get a pizza that you simply pop in the oven, or meals that you can quickly cook in the microwave in a few minutes. The preparation time is much lesser, and you can quickly put some food on the table. Cost-wise this is more affordable than all the previous options, and might be a decent option for those with families.</li><li>The final option is to prepare all your meals yourself from scratch, and is the most cost effective and healthy but most time consuming. However, you can save time by setting aside a day on the weekend to food prep for the entire week. It can be a great time to bond with family. Save time by reusing pots and pans, cleaning as you go and cooking for multiple days while the oven is hot.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Cutting vegetables and meat</li><li>Lighting a stovetop</li><li>Stirring food</li><li>Cutting bread</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Laundry Service<ul><li>If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for. How it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.</li><li>The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you.</li><li>If you have a washer and dryer at home, then you can run loads whenever it time, and couple folding with something like watching TV and make it a family effort to knock it out of the park. At home, when I get the kids involved in folding and putting away their clothes, stuff goes super quickly. So I&rsquo;ve never had the need for a laundry service, but hey everyone&rsquo;s needs are different and your milage may vary!</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Carrying laundry basket</li><li>Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials</li><li>Folding clothes, putting on hangars</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Commute<ul><li>As of 2019, Americans spend about 27.6 mins each way in their commute on average, and about 10% spend an hour or more. Minimizing commute time can make a significant improvement in your quality of life, and get you back a big portion of your day.</li><li>But to Minimize your work commute, you might need to spend more to live closer to your workplace, and depending on your industry and location, this might actually end up costing you more in mortgage or rent. The cost can be controlled by choosing a smaller place to live, or a less fancy house, but the baseline is you&rsquo;ll be making these tradeoffs.</li><li>Or, if you can live in a place that allows you to use public transportation to commute to and from work, then it is a great option because your actually have time to read or work during your commute!</li><li>If you are lucky enough to have the option for remote work, then none of this applies - so let&rsquo;s move on to the next one.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Getting in car and driving away</li><li>Pulling up into driveway and getting out</li><li>Fast forward video of driving through traffic</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Home and car maintenance<ul><li>If you own a home, you already know there is a long list of pending projects you&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to. It might make sense for you to outsource your routine maintenance work so that you can get to the projects that have a higher impact on your home.</li><li>For routine stuff like Mowing lawn, trimming outgrowth, or Pool cleaning, you can hire people who come in and do these services for you on a regular basis.</li><li>For one off, but specialty Tree removal</li><li>Get a handyman to make repairs that would take anywhere upwards or a few hours</li><li>Plumbing, electrical, fences, window cleaning, pressure washing, strip and restain wood floors, rooing, remodel, HVAC, gutter cleaning,</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Walking through tall grass</li><li>Enjoying short cut grass</li><li>Pulling weeds, trimming hedges</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Online Shopping</li><li>Virtual Assistant<ul><li>If you have a lot of administrative tasks to do, consider hiring a virtual assistant. They can help you with tasks like scheduling appointments, responding to emails, and managing your calendar.</li></ul></li><li>Child care<ul><li>Nanny</li><li>Baby sitter</li><li>Mothers helper</li></ul></li></ul><p>Food:
