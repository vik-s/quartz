Mar 24, 2023</p><ul class=tags></ul><p>Money compounds when invested properly but time is a continuously depleted resource. We cant store it, we can&rsquo;t compound it. It&rsquo;s use it or lose it. We trade our time for money at our jobs, but what if you can spend money to get more time? Instead, use your time to learn something new, exercise, build relationships, relax - or&mldr; make this youtube video. Apart from time, there are more reasons why you should not do everything yourself.</p><ul><li>some things need an expert to get done properly</li><li>it may be beyond your current physical ability</li><li>you just don&rsquo;t enjoy doing it</li><li>you may risk hurting yourself</li></ul><p>In this video, we&rsquo;ll talk about 6 ways in which you can buy back your time with money. To save you time with this video, checkout the timestamps below to quickly navigate as you would like.</p><ul><li>Housecleaning<ul><li>For the longest time, I was resisting getting help on this one and did everything myself. I told myself that I am not that busy or that entitled to clean up after myself, then I convinced myself that no cleaning service can match my OCD-infused levels of ultra-cleanliness</li><li>As it turns out none of this is true. I finally came around to admitting that I needed the help given that we have children and two full time jobs, and that cleaners are super professional at what they do and generally do a good job. I realized that I am just being a control freak over this whole cleaning matter. It dawned on me that, not only do I spend the time cleaning, I spend time recovering energy from my cleaning work. It was time to hire someone to clean - but how much does it really cost?</li><li>House cleaning services typically run 20-50/hr of work depending on where you live and who you ask. You can get quotes from cleaning companies in your area. If you&rsquo;ve never got your housed professionally cleaned before, they might insist that you get a deep cleaning first - which can run you about 300-400. You can determine the frequency of house cleaning depending on how quickly it gets dirty and how much you want to spend on the service. Or, you can even get just deep cleanings done once in a few months, where things like blinds, fans and refridgerators get cleaned out too, and this typically runs about 200-500 depending on the size of your house.</li><li>This might be too expensive for some people, that&rsquo;s totally understandable. In that case, get a good vacuum cleaner, something that is lightweight like a Dyson or even automatic like a Roomba. These can be expensive, but it is a one time cost that will reduce your time to clean, or make you less tired because it won&rsquo;t weight a ton. Dumping your old heavy vacuum cleaner for a more modern one is just low hanging fruit.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Running the vacuum cleaner around the house</li><li>Wiping a countertop</li><li>Dusting some surfaces with a mask on.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Home and car maintenance<ul><li>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who absolutely love to do-it-yourself, and derive happiness from it, hey, good on you, you&rsquo;re going to save a lot of money, and have a good time while doing so!</li><li>However, if home and car upkeep is not your jam, then you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay your way out of it. When it comes to home maintenance, some things can cost an arm and a leg (and your firstborn &ndash; just kidding), and some stuff is relatively inexpensive, so let&rsquo;s go through some of them.<ul><li>Lawn care &ndash; this is going to cost you like 50-100 bucks per mow depending on your lot size, and where you live in the united states, but if you dont enjoy doing this yourself, its fairly simple to have someone to come in to take care of it.</li><li>Pest control &ndash; this one costs about 100 / visit and it is probably sufficient to have some one come to take a look every couple of months or so, and I don&rsquo;t believe anyone particularly loves dealing with pests, so forking out some cash may be worth your while</li><li>Plumbing &ndash; I have a simple rule. If I can&rsquo;t unblock a drain by snaking it, call a plumber. I am fairly dumb when it comes to plumbing and things get messy real quick, so i&rsquo;d rather have some one come over. It&rsquo;s hard to give a cost estimate because the quote to fix will depend on how extensive your plumbing issues are. So I&rsquo;ll just leave that with a (shrug)</li><li>Car care &ndash; I always get tire rotations and oil changes done at a local garage, because it is much easier to do when the car is on a hoist. And I don&rsquo;t want to be responsible for proper disposal of engine oil. Technically, brake pads are rather easy to do yourself, but getting a professional to do it gives you the peace of mind that the car is still safe to drive.</li><li>Apart from this, there is a whole lot out there like tree removal, plumbing, electrical, fences, windown cleaning, roofing, HVAC, gutter cleaning&mldr; which is too much for this video</li></ul></li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Walking through tall grass</li><li>Enjoying short cut grass</li><li>Pulling weeds, trimming hedges</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Laundry Service<ul><li>If you dislike spending time on doing and folding laundry, there are laundry services that you can sign up for. How it works is - they send you a laundry bag that you can fill with clothes, sheets, towels and stuff. then they pick it up - wash, dry and fold it, and drop it off at your doorstep in a day or two.</li><li>The rates around me are about $1.50-$2 a pound of clothes, so you really need to evaluate the amount of laundry you generate, how much time you spend doing laundry and how much your time is worth to you.</li><li>If you have a washer and dryer at home, then you can run loads whenever possible, and couple folding with something like watching TV and make it a family effort to knock it out of the park. At home, when I get the kids involved in folding and putting away their clothes, stuff goes super quickly. So I&rsquo;ve never had the need for a laundry service, but hey everyone&rsquo;s needs are different and your milage may vary!</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Carrying laundry basket</li><li>Putting a washing soap pellet and turning dials</li><li>Folding clothes, putting on hangars

Eating out, while making the healthiest food choices can definitely save you time, good quality food, even if readily available around you, can be very expensive over the long term. I do have friends who say that the overhead of buying groceries, preparing food, dealing with the ensuing kitchen clean up, etc, is simply not for them, and argue that the expense of eating out is totally worth it.</li><li>An alternative to eating out all the time is to have pre-prepared meal kits delivered at your doorstep, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to prepare your meals. There are companies such as Hello Fresh, or Fresh n Lean that ship to your door step, and you get a variety of diet choices like vegan, paleo, or keto. The cost per serving is typically between $10-$20, and while this calculus might work out for some people, it is simply not an option for those with larger families, in my humble opinion.</li><li>Another option is to get Pre-prepared meals from places like Costco or similar grocery stores, where you get a pizza that you simply pop in the oven, or meals that you can quickly cook in the microwave in a few minutes. The preparation time is much lesser, and you can quickly put some food on the table. Cost-wise this is more affordable than all the previous options, and might be a decent option for those with families.</li><li>The final option is to prepare all your meals yourself from scratch, and is the most cost effective and healthy but most time consuming. However, you can save time by setting aside a day on the weekend to food prep for the entire week. It can be a great time to bond with family. Save time by reusing pots and pans, cleaning as you go and cooking for multiple days while the oven is hot. When food is ready, pack them into lunch boxes and stow them away in the fridge.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Cutting vegetables and meat</li><li>Lighting a stovetop</li><li>Stirring food</li><li>Cutting bread</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Commute<ul><li>As of 2019, Americans spend about 27.6 mins each way in their commute on average, and about 10% spend an hour or more. Minimizing commute time can make a significant improvement in your quality of life, and get you back a big portion of your day.</li><li>But to minimize your work commute, you will need to live closer to your workplace, and depending on your industry and location, this might actually end up costing you more in mortgage or rent. The cost can be controlled by choosing a smaller or less fancy place to live, but this is a real tradeoff we have to make. The silver lining is that you will pay lesser in transportation costs, may even eliminate the need to own a car, or simply be able to use public transportation.</li><li>If you are lucky enough to have the option for remote work, then none of this applies - so let&rsquo;s move on to the next one.</li><li><strong>B-ROLL</strong><ul><li>Getting in car and driving away</li><li>Pulling up into driveway and getting out</li><li>Fast forward video of driving through traffic</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Child care<ul><li>I&rsquo;ve got to say up front that time spent with your child is priceless, and is something you can never outsource. However, every so often we could all use a little extra help around the house so that you can actually spend quality, uninterrupted time with your child and be there for them at the age they need you most. For this, you can actually hire what is called a Mothers helper. So care.com (not sponsoring this video) has an article that describes what a mothers helper does .<ul><li>Do dishes while you play with the kids</li><li>Run some errands</li><li>Play with older children, while moms tend to the younger child</li><li>Help decorate the house, or wrap gifts</li><li>Help with homework</li></ul></li><li>Typically mothers helpers are &ldquo;baby sitters in training&rdquo; - so that they can help watch kids while the parents are around. They are typically less expensive overall than hiring a full time nanny. But since I only learned of mothers helpers more recently, and my kids are much older now, I&rsquo;ve never had the chance to actually hire them. If you did, leave your experience in the comments below. That would greatly help out- thanks.</li><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>To summarize, here are the six services that allow you to buy back your time so that you can deploy it in the most meaningful ways in your life.</p><p>Food:
