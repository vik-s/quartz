If you were to pick one form of exercise, it should be resistance training It gives all benefits of cardio in addition to: Muscle and bone strength Osteoporosis (esp for women) is a possibility with age Resistance training makes muscle pull on the bone, and strengthens the bone Weight bearing exercise strengthens bone, not other forms of exercise Cycling, swimming, and other forms of cardio does not help bone density, maybe running is ok to some extent Compound motions like squats, rows, presses, pushups are very helpful for bone density Even &amp;gt;70 yr olds see massive improvements in muscle strength when they start lifting, in 8-12 weeks, even if they have never training before.</description></item><item><title>How food powers your body</title><link>https://notes.vsekar.com/literature/A-How-Food-Powers-Your-Body-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.vsekar.com/literature/A-How-Food-Powers-Your-Body-2022/</guid><description>Life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest
